# Data Storage

The primary purpose of this editor is to create a folder of files, one file for each problem, which you download to your computer and then upload to GitHub where they become accessible to the site. There are a few levels of storage between a blank page and a finished problems folder, so we describe them here.

# Standalone Problem

You can write problems and save them one at a time. Click the save button and this site will generate a file containing the active problem and will offer it to you to save somewhere on your computer. This is the simplest way to obtain a single problem file. The downside to this is that you have to enter all metadata from scratch with this approach, causing potential differences with other metadata throughout the qual's problems.

# Problem in a Qual

If you have succesfully initiated a qual on this site and have given the qual some problems, you will want to preload the whole qual page's set of problems before you work on new problems for that qual. Doing this lets the editor populate metadata lists with the metadata from all the problems in the qual, and this helps organize the whole folder at once. To do this, enter the name of your qual in the appropriate input.

When a qual is loaded you can open a saved problem by entering the id into the box. This allows you to modify existing problems. Remember this does not actually affect the site -- you still have change the folder on GitHub in order for your changes to actually be made live.

If you want to create a new problem in a qual, click the Clear/New Problem button. This will generate a blank problem with an id of changeMe, which you have to change or else your problem will be ignored by the site. You can create multiple new problems in a session without saving each one independently. Once you have finished your session and are ready to download the new problems all at once (along with all the old problems too), click the save all button to get a .zip folder with all problems in that qual. You have to unzip the folder on your own computer and then put that new folder onto GitHub to make the changes affect the website.

# Local Problems

There is a way to work with auto saving, where each problem is kept stored in browser storage so that they are not lost when you close the window. To do this, enter "local" as the qual when you begin. This creates and maintains a local repository of questions inside your browser, so you only have to click save when you are ready to use the folder. Enter "local qualName" to initialize the local repository with the current set of problems for the corresponding qual.

The erase button for local storage will erase all the locally stored problems from browser memory. This is essentially so you can free up memory space without losing the other browser-stored data like instructor names which would be lost in a total browser memory clear.
