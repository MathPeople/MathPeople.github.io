<problem><p>Let \(\gamma(t)=e^{it}, 0\leq t\leq 2\pi\). Let \(f(x)\) be any odd function analytic on a neighborhood of \(\overline{B}_1(0)\). Evaluate</p><p>\[\int_\gamma\frac{f(z)}{z^3}dz.\]</p></problem><solution><p>We can solve this with the residue theorem. Because \(f\) is odd it has a power series representation of only odd terms,</p><p>\[f(z)=a_1z+a_3z^3+a_5z^5+\cdots\]</p><p>The Laurent expansion of \(\frac{f(z)}{z^3}\) can be found by dividing each term by \(z^3\), giving</p><p>\[f(z)=\frac{a_1}{z^2}+a_3+a_5z^2+\cdots\]</p><p>This function has no residue because there is no \(z^{-1}\) term, so by the residue theorem the integral vanishes.</p></solution><topics><CauchyIntegralFormula/><ResidueTheorem/><Laurent/></topics><instructors><d/></instructors>
