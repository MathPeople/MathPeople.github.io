<problem><p>Suppose \(\Omega\) is simply connected and \(f:\Omega\to\mathbb{C}\) is holomorphic and never vanishes. Show that \(f\) factors through \(\exp\), i.e. show there is a holomorphic function \(g:\Omega\to\mathbb{C}\) such that</p><p>\[f(z)=e^{g(z)}\]</p><p>We denote \(g\) by \(\ln f\). Conclude that any simply connected domain which does not include the origin admits a branch of log.</p></problem><solution><p>First we take the derivative of the assumed equation to get</p><p>\[f&apos;(z)=e^{g(z)}g&apos;(z)=f(z)g&apos;(z)\]</p><p>That is, if \(g\) exists then \(g&apos;=\frac{f&apos;}{f}\). Thus we will construct an antiderivative of \(\frac{f&apos;}{f}\). Notice that \(f\) never vanishes so \(\frac{f&apos;}{f}\) is an entire function. Therefore by Cauchy&apos;s integral theorem, for any loop \(\gamma\) in \(\mathbb{C}\),</p><p>\[\int_\gamma\frac{f&apos;(z)}{f(z)}dz=0\]</p><p>(We could also use the argument principle here -- the above integral is \(2\pi i(Z-P)\) where \(Z,P\) are the zeroes and poles of \(f\), of which there are none)</p><p>From here we copy the proof of Morera&apos;s theorem. Let \(a\in\mathbb{C}\) and choose a path \(p_a\) from \(0\) to \(a\). Define</p><p>\[g(a)=\int_{p_a}\frac{f&apos;(z)}{f(z)}dz\]</p><p>This definition is path independent by the above vanishing integral. We will show via difference quotient that \(g&apos;=\frac{f&apos;}{f}\). For \(x\in\mathbb{C}\) let \(p_x(t)=tx\). For \(x,y\in\mathbb{C}\) let \(p_x^y(t)=(1-t)x+ty\), and use \(+\) to represent path concatenation. Then</p><p>\[\lim_{h\to0}\frac{g(a+h)-g(a)}{h}=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{1}{h}\left(\int_{p_a+p_a^{a+h}}\frac{f&apos;(z)}{f(z)}dz-\int_{p_a}\frac{f&apos;(z)}{f(z)}dz\right)=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{1}{h}\int_{p_a^{a+h}}\frac{f&apos;(z)}{f(z)}dz\]</p><p>\[=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{1}{h}\int_0^1\frac{f&apos;(a+th)}{f(a+th)}hdt=\lim_{h\to0}\int_0^1\frac{f&apos;(a+th)}{f(a+th)}dt\]</p><p>Convergence is uniform on compact sets, so limits come in and we get</p><p>\[=\int_0^1\frac{f&apos;(a)}{f(a)}dt=\frac{f&apos;(a)}{f(a)}\]</p><p>Thus \(g\) is holomorphic with derivative \(\frac{f&apos;}{f}\). Now we show this does what we want by showing \(\frac{f}{e^g}\) is constant.</p><p>\[\left(\frac{f}{e^g}\right)&apos;=\frac{f&apos;e^g-f\left(e^g\right)&apos;}{e^{2g}}\]</p><p>The numerator is</p><p>\[f&apos;e^g-f\left(e^g\right)&apos;=f&apos;e^g-fe^gg&apos;=f&apos;e^g-fe^g\frac{f&apos;}{f}=0\]</p><p>Thus \(\frac{f}{e^g}\) is constant, so \(f=\alpha e^g\) for some constant \(\alpha\). We know \(\alpha\neq0\), so take some \(\beta\) such that \(e^\beta=\alpha\). This is possible in the scope of this problem because \(\alpha\) is just a number. Then \(f=e^\beta e^g=e^{\beta+g}\).</p><p>The second part is just applying the result to the nonvanishing holomorphic function \(z:\Omega\to\mathbb{C}\). The resulting \(g\) is by definition a branch of log.</p></solution><topics><BranchOfLog/><CauchyIntegralTheorem/><Morera/><ElementaryDefinitions/></topics><instructors><e/></instructors>
