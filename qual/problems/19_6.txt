<problem><p>Let \(G\) be a region and \(u\) a nonconstant harmonic function on \(G\). Show \(u\) is an open map.</p></problem><solution><p>Let \(a\in G\) and choose \(r&gt;0\) small enough that \(B_r(a)\) is compactly contained in \(G\). Then \(u\) has a harmonic conjugate on \(B_r(a)\), so \(u(z)=\Re(f(z))\) on \(B_r(a)\). By the open mapping theorem \(f\) is an open map, so \(f(B_r(a))\) is open. Then \(u(B_r(a))\) is also open. Thus \(u\) is an open map.</p></solution><topics><PointSetTopology/><OpenMappingTheorem/><HarmonicConjugate/></topics><instructors><c/><f/></instructors>
