<problem><p>State Cauchy&apos;s theorem on simply connected regions. Prove that any holomorphic function on a simply connected region admits an antiderivative.</p></problem><solution><p>Let \(G\) be a simply connected region and let \(f:G\to\mathbb{C}\) be holomorphic. Cauchy&apos;s theorem states that for all closed piecewise smooth paths \(\gamma:[a,b]\to G\),</p><p>\[\int_\gamma f(z)dz=0\]</p><p>We will use this to construct an antiderivative of \(f\). Fix a point \(x\in G\). For arbitrary \(z\in G\) let \(p_z\) denote a piecewise smooth path in \(G\) starting at \(x\) and ending at \(z\). Define \(F\) by </p><p>\[F(z)=\int_{p_z}f(w)dw\]</p><p> We need to check that this is well-defined. Suppose \(p_z,p&apos;_z\) are two paths in \(G\) starting at \(x\) and ending at \(z\). Then the concatenation \(\gamma\) of \(p_z\) with the reverse of \(p&apos;_z\) is a loop in \(G\), so by Cauchy&apos;s integral theorem </p><p>\[\int_{p_z}f(w)dw-\int_{p&apos;_z}f(w)dw=\int_\gamma f(w)dw=0\]</p><p> Thus \(F\) is well-defined. \(F\) is an antiderivative by construction but a detailed reasoning is given in the proof of Morera&apos;s theorem.</p></solution><topics><CauchyIntegralTheorem/></topics><instructors><c/></instructors>
