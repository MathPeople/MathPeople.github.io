<problem><p>Let \(f_n\) be a sequence of analytic functions on a region \(\Omega\) which converges to \(f\) uniformly on compact subsets. Let \(a\in\Omega\). Suppose each \(f_n\) is injective and that \(f&apos;(a)&gt;0\). Show that \(f\) is injective and that eventually \(f_n&apos;(a)\neq0\).</p></problem><solution><p>First, the second claim is quick. Because \(f_n\to f\), we also get \(f_n&apos;\to f&apos;\). Because \(f&apos;(a)\neq0\), by definition of limit eventually \(f_n&apos;(a)\neq0\) as well.</p><p>We will use Hurwitz&apos;s theorem. Because \(f&apos;(a)&gt;0\), we know \(f\neq0\). Then Hurwitz&apos;s theorem gives us that for every point \(x\in\Omega\), let \(d_x\) be the multiplicity of \(f\) at \(x\). For every ball \(B_x\) sufficiently small centered at \(x\), eventually \(|f_m^{-1}(f(x))\cap B_x|=d_x\) counting multiplicity. </p><p>\[\]</p><p> Suppose \(x\neq y\in\Omega\) and \(f(x)=f(y)=z\). Then take two small balls \(B_x\) and \(B_y\) of \(x,y\), small enough that they are disjoint and such that Hurwitz&apos;s theorem applies. Let \(d_x,d_y\) be the multiplicities of \(f\) at \(x,y\). By Hurwitz&apos;s theorem, eventually \(|f_m^{-1}(z)\cap B_x|=d_x\) and \(|f_m^{-1}(z)\cap B_y|=d_y\). In particular, because \(d_x+d_y\geq1+1=2\), we cannot have that \(f_m\) are injective. This contradicts our injectivity assumption, so no such \(x\neq y\) can exist.</p></solution><topics><PointSetTopology/><SequenceOfFunctions/><Degree/><Hurwitz/></topics><instructors><a/><c/></instructors>
