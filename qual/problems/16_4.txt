<problem><p>Let \(\gamma(t)=e^{it}\) for \(0\leq t\leq2\pi\). Evaluate</p><p>\[\int_\gamma\ln\left(\frac{z-2i}{z+2i}\right)dz\]</p><p>You will need to specify your branch of log.</p></problem><solution><p>We want to see where \(\gamma\) goes under the Mobius transformation \(\frac{z-2i}{z+2i}\). To do this, map a few points. \(\gamma\) follows \(1\mapsto i\mapsto-1\mapsto-i\mapsto1\), this becomes</p><p>\[-\frac{3}{5}-\frac{4}{5}i\mapsto-\frac{1}{3}\mapsto-\frac{3}{5}+\frac{4}{5}i\mapsto-3\mapsto-\frac{3}{5}-\frac{4}{5}i\]</p><p>Note the pole occurs at \(-2i\), outside the region encircled by \(\gamma\). </p><p> Regardless of our branch of log, it will always be holomorphic if it can be defined. If we define our branch of log for \(\theta\in(0,2\pi)\) then our branch is defined on the interior of the image of \(\gamma\), so by Cauchy&apos;s integral theorem the integral vanishes.</p></solution><topics><BranchOfLog/><MobiusTransformation/><CauchyIntegralTheorem/></topics><instructors><a/><c/></instructors>
