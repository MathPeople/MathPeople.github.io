<problem><p>State and prove a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a meromorphic function on a compact Riemann surface \(X\) with given residues.</p></problem><solution><p>Let \(D = \{p_1,\cdots,p_d\}\) be \(d\) distinct points in \(X\). Then there exists a meromorphic function \(f\) with residues at some subset of \(\{T_1,\cdots,T_d\}\) if and only if for all \(\theta \in H_X^{(1,0)}\), we have</p><p>\[\sum_{i=1}^d\langle T_i,\theta(p_i)\rangle=0\]</p><p>\[\implies\]</p><p> Assume there exists a meromorphic function \(f\) with residues at some subset of \(\{T_1,\cdots,T_d\}\). Let \(\theta\) be a holomorphic one form on \(X\). Observe that \(f\theta\) is a meromorphic one form on a compact Riemann surface. Thus by a previous homework problem (homework 2 problem 2), we know the sum of residues of \(f\theta\) is equal to 0. This is precisely the desired result. </p><p>\[\impliedby\]</p><p> Assume that for any holomorphic one form \(\theta\), we have \(\sum_{i=1}^d\langle T_i,\theta(p_i)\rangle=0\). Consider the \(\overline{\partial}\) construction: </p><p>\[\sum_{i=1}^d\lambda_i\overline{\partial}\frac{\beta_i}{z-p_i}=[b]\in H_X^{(0,1)}\]</p><p> Note that \(\langle b,\theta\rangle\) is definite and by our assumption, we know for any \(\theta\), \(\langle b,\theta\rangle=0\). Therefore \([b]=0\). This means \(b=\overline{\partial}f\). By solving the \(\overline{\partial}\) equation like before, we can find a meromorphic function with poles at each point in \(D\).</p></solution><topics><ResidueTheorem/><RiemannSurfaces/><DifferentialForms/><Meromorphic/></topics><instructors><a/></instructors>
