<problem><p>Show all solutions of \(e^z=3z^2\) with \(|z|&lt;1\) are also solutions of \(z=\overline z\).</p></problem><solution><p>We will use Rouche&apos;s theorem, which states that if \(|f|&lt;|g|\) on \(\partial\Omega\) then \(g\) and \(f+g\) have the same number of roots in \(\Omega\). First look at the function \(e^z-3z^2=e^z+(-3z^2)\), we want the roots of this function. If \(|z|=1\), then \(|-3z^2|=3\). Also,</p><p>\[|e^z|=|e^{x+iy}|=|e^x|=e^x\]</p><p>and </p><p>\[\frac{1}{e}\leq e^x\leq e\]</p><p> for \(-1\leq x\leq1\). Additionally, \(e&lt;3\) so in particular \(|e^z|\leq e&lt;3=|-3z^2|\). Now we know how many roots \(-3z^2\) has in the unit disc, it has 2 (we have to count multiplicity). That means \(e^z-3z^2\) has 2 roots in the unit disc. However, \(e^z-3z^2\) has 2 roots on the real interval \((-1,1)\), we can prove this with the intermediate value theorem. If \(h(x)=e^x-3x^2\) then </p><p>\[h(-1)=\frac{1}{e}-3&lt;0\]</p><p> </p><p>\[h(0)=1&gt;0\]</p><p> </p><p>\[h(1)=e-3&lt;0\]</p><p> Thus \(h\) has a (real) root between \(-1\) and \(0\) and another root between \(0\) and \(1\). These are the only roots of \(e^z-3z^2\), as we already saw, by Rouche&apos;s theorem. The fact that they are real means they are solutions to \(z=\overline z\), as required.</p></solution><topics><FunctionBounds/><Degree/><Rouche/></topics><instructors><a/><b/></instructors>
