<problem><p>Suppose \(\gamma\) is a closed rectifiable curve in \(\mathbb{C}\). Show that if \(a\) and \(b\) are in the same connected component of \(\mathbb{C}\setminus\gamma\) then the winding numbers \(n(\gamma; a)=n(\gamma; b)\).</p></problem><solution><p>Reparametrize \(\gamma\) if necessary so its domain is \([0,1]\). Recall the definition of winding number.</p><p>\[n(\gamma;a)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_\gamma\frac{1}{z-a}dz=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_0^1\frac{1}{\gamma(t)-a}\gamma&apos;(t)dt\]</p><p>Let \(\gamma_1\) be the curve \(\gamma_1(t)=\gamma(t)+a-b\).

Let \(G\) be the path component of \(\mathbb{C}\setminus\gamma\) containing both \(a\) and \(b\) and let \(p:[0,1]\to G\) be a path such that \(p(0)=a\) and \(p(1)=b\). For \(s\in[0,1]\) define the shifted path \(c_s(t)=\gamma(t)+a-p(s)\). Then \(c_s\) is a path homotopy taking \(\gamma\) to \(\gamma_1\), it remains to show that \(c_s(t)\neq a\) for all \(s,t\). Suppose there were some \(s,t\) for which \(c_s(t)=a\). Then </p><p>\[\gamma(t)+a-p(s)=a\]</p><p> </p><p>\[\gamma(t)=p(s)\]</p><p> However, \(p\) maps into \(G\subseteq\mathbb{C}\setminus\gamma\), so \(p(s)\neq\gamma(t)\) for all \(s,t\). Thus \(c_s(t)\neq a\) for all \(s,t\). That makes \(c_s\) a path homotopy from \(\gamma\) to \(\gamma_1\) in \(\mathbb{C}\setminus\{a\}\). Then </p><p>\[n(\gamma;a)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_\gamma\frac{1}{z-a}dz=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\gamma_1}\frac{1}{z-a}dz=n(\gamma;b)\]</p></solution><topics><PointSetTopology/><CauchyIntegralTheorem/><WindingNumber/></topics><instructors><c/></instructors>
