<problem2><problem tex="Show the cohomology ring $H^*$ of the circle (with integer coefficients) is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}$. Let $x$ be a generator of this ring, so $x$ represents a loop which goes once around the circle, and compute $x+x$."><solutionCompleteness radio="none"><partial/></solutionCompleteness><topics><addition/><differentialTopology/></topics><difficulty scale="2"/></problem><solution tex="We skip the cohomology part for now. Once we have shown that it is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}$, choose an isomorphism $\phi:H^*(S^1)\to\mathbb{Z}$. We know $x$ generates $H^*$, so $\phi(x)=\pm1$. By postcomposing with the negation map on $\mathbb{Z}$ if necessary, we can assume $\phi(x)=1$. Then $x+x$ is&#xA;\[\phi^{-1}(1)+\phi^{-1}(1)=\phi^{-1}(1+1)\]&#xA;which, by problem 1, is $\phi^{-1}(2)$. Note $x+x$ represents going around the circle twice in whichever direction $x$ went around, and the negation map on $\mathbb{Z}$ corresponds to reversing the direction of the loops. When we did our WLOG above we essentially declared that the direction of $x$ is the positive direction."/></problem2>
