  <solution tex="Uniqueness comes from the Schwarz lemma. Suppose $f,g$ are both biholomorphisms from $\Omega$ to the disc with $f(a)=g(a)=0$ and $f'(a)&gt;0, g'(a)&gt;0$. Then $H=f\circ g^{-1}$ and $H^{-1}=g\circ f^{-1}$ are automorphisms of the disc which fix 0, so by the Scharz lemma&#xA;\[|H(z)|\leq|z|=|H^{-1}(H(z))|\leq|H(z)|\]&#xA;Therefore the inequalities are equalities and by Schwarz lemma $H=\lambda\cdot\text{id}$, or $(f\circ g^{-1})(z)=\lambda z$, where $|\lambda|=1$. Taking the derivative of both sides at $z=0$ gives\[\frac{f'(a)}{g'(a)}=\lambda\]Because both $f'(a)$ and $g'(a)$ are positive real numbers, $\lambda$ must be a positive real number as well. Also we know $|\lambda|=1$, so $\lambda=1$ making $f\circ g^{-1}=\text{id}$. That shows $f=g$.\[\]Now to show that the Riemann map exists. We first need to show there exists a nonconstant bounded holomorphic function $f$ on $\Omega$. From there we can do some analysis to construct the biholomorphism. We are going to perform a series of injective holomorphic transformations to our region $\Omega$. First, we assumed that $\Omega$ is not the whole plane so let $z_0\notin\mathbb{C}$. Then define $\Omega_1$ to be the image of $\Omega$ under the map $z-z_0$. Then $\Omega_1$ is a simply connected region which does not contain 0 and is biholomorphic to $\Omega$.\[\]Now we are going to define a branch of log on $\Omega_1$. Fix a point $l\in\Omega_1$ and for any $z\in\Omega_1$ let $p_z$ be a path in $\Omega_1$ starting at $l$ and ending at $z$. Define \[\ln(z)=\int_{p_z}\frac{1}{z}dz\]First we need to check this is well-defined. Suppose $p_z,p'_z$ are two paths from $l$ to $z$. Then $p_z-p'_z$ is a loop in $\Omega_1$. Because $\Omega_1$ is simply connected, this loop is contractible. Then by Cauchy's integral theorem (homotopy version),\[\int_{p_z}\frac{1}{z}dz-\int_{p'_z}\frac{1}{z}dz=\int_{p_z-p'_z}\frac{1}{z}dz=\int_l\frac{1}{z}dz=0\]Thus our function $\ln$ is well-defined. As to why it is a branch of log, by construction $\ln'(z)=\frac{1}{z}$ and $\ln(l)=0$. For fun we will now show that any antiderivative of $\frac{1}{z}$ with a certain initial condition satisfied by our $\ln$ must be a branch of log.\[\]Suppose $f$ is a function defined on a region in $\mathbb{C}^*$ with $f'(z)=\frac{1}{z}$ and suppose there is some $a$ in our region and some integer $k$ for which $f(a)=2k\pi i$. Then\[\left(e^f\right)'(z)=\frac{e^{f(z)}}{z}\]Thus $e^f$ is a solution to the differential equation $f'(z)=\frac{1}{z}f(z)$. The solution space to this equation is one dimensional (first order equation) and is spanned by the identity function, so $e^f=\lambda\text{id}$. To solve for $\lambda$, plug in $a$ to get $\lambda a=e^{f(a)}=e^{2k\pi i}=1$. Thus $e^f=\text{id}$, so $f$ is a branch of log.\[\]Now we have constructed a branch of log on $\Omega_1$. Note that branches of log are injective because by definition a branch of log is a section of the exponential map and sections must be injective (section means right inverse). Define the map $\sqrt z$ on $\Omega_1$ by $\sqrt{z}=e^{\frac{1}{2}\ln(z)}$. Note $\left(e^{\frac{1}{2}\ln(z)}\right)^2=e^{\ln(z)}=z$. The property we are interested in for $\sqrt z$ is called $\pm$ injectivity. Suppose that $a,b$ are in $\Omega_1$ and $\sqrt a=\pm\sqrt b$. Squaring both sides gives that $a=b$. Note that $\pm$ injectivity implies, in particular, injectivity. Define $\Omega_2$ to be the image of $\Omega_1$ under $\sqrt z$.\[\]Now we have a region $\Omega_2$ which is biholomorphic to $\Omega$. Moreover, being the image of a region under the exponential map, $0\notin\Omega_2$. We will show $\Omega_2$ is actually missing an entire neighborhood of $\mathbb{C}$. Choose any point $c\in\Omega_2$ and any ball $B$ centered at $c$ with $B\subset\Omega_2$. Such a ball exists because $\Omega$ was open and biholomorphisms are open maps, so $\Omega_2$ is open. Define $-B=\{z|-z\in B\}$. We will show $-B\cap\Omega_2=\emptyset$. Suppose $w\in-B$. Then $-w\in B\subset\Omega_2$, so $-w=\sqrt z$ for some $z\in\Omega_1$, or $w=-\sqrt{z}$. If there were some $z'\in\Omega_1$ with $w=\sqrt{z'}$ then $\sqrt{z'}=-\sqrt z$, which by $\pm$ injectivity means $z=z'$, meaning $w=-w=0$. However, $0\notin\Omega_2$. Thus $-B\cap\Omega_2=\emptyset$.\[\]Define $\Omega_3$ to be the image of $\Omega_2$ under the biholomorphism $z-(-c)=z+c$. This biholomorphism puts the center of $-B$ at the origin. Let $r$ be the radius of $B$. Then for all $z\in\Omega_3, |z|&gt;r$.\[\]Define $\Omega_4$ to be the image of $\Omega_3$ under the injective holomorphism $\frac{1}{z}$. Then for all $z\in\Omega_4, z=\frac{1}{y}$ for some $y\in\Omega_3$. Being in $\Omega_3, |y|&gt;r$. Thus $|z|&lt;\frac{1}{r}$. That is, $\Omega_4$ is a bounded domain which is biholomorphic to $\Omega$.\[\]From here we can use translations, rotations, and scaling to obtain an injective holomorphism from $\Omega$ into the unit disc which sends $a$ to $0$ with positive derivative. If we consider the set of all such functions, we can do a supremum argument on the value of the derivative at $a$ to obtain a sequence of functions. We can show this sequence converges to the Riemann map we are looking for. This part of the proof is never on the qual so we won't go into it here."/>
