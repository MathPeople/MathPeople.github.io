For our interests, we want to show that $N$ has a complex structure.&#xA;Observe that for each $(w_0, z_0) \in N$, at least one of the partial derivatives for $f$ ($f_w = 2w$, $f_z = -\cos(z)$) does not vanish. If we chose a point of $N$ where $f_w$ does not vanish, then by theorem 1 (pg 5 in Donaldson), we can find discs $D_1$, $D_2$, and a holomorphic map $\phi:D_1\to D_2$ such that $N \cap (D_1 \times D_2) = \{(z, \phi(z)) \}$ (graph of $\phi$). We can make coordinate charts $U_\alpha = N \cap (D_1 \times D_2)$ with $\tilde{U_\alpha} = D_1$ and $\psi_\alpha$ the restriction of projection from $D_1 \times D_2 $ to $D_1$. Similarly, if we chose a point where $f_z$ doesnt vanish, we can find discs $B_1, B_2$ and holomorphic maps $g:B_2\to B_1$ such that $N \cap (B_1 \times B_2) = \{(g(w) , w)\}$. Note that we can now find a collection of charts of either the first or second kind which cover $N$. In either case, the overlapping map will be the identity on suitable intersection of discs in $\mathbb{C}$. Observe that for the overlapping map between charts of the first and second kind will be the composite $z \longrightarrow (z, \phi(z)) \longrightarrow \phi(z)$. This is just the holomorphic map $\phi$. In each case, the map is holomorphic. Hence $N$ has a complex structure which implies $N$ is a Riemann surface."/></C1_3>
