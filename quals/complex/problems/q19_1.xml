Justify your answer." solutionCompleteness="full" questionViability="good"><instructors><c/><f/></instructors><topics><FundamentalTheoremOfAlgebra/><ElementaryDefinitions/></topics><solution tex="Suppose $f(z)=a$. Then&#xA;\[z^2-2z=a\]&#xA;\[z^2-2z+1=a+1.\]&#xA;By the fundamental theorem of algebra there is a complex number $b$ with $b^2=a+1$. Take such a $b$.&#xA;\[(z-1)^2=b^2\]&#xA;\[z=1\pm b.\]&#xA;Unless $b=0$ (which is only when $a=-1$), there are two distinct preimages of $a$ under $f$. Moreover these two roots are symmetric centered around $1$, as in $1$ is the midpoint between the two roots. Thus the largest desired radius is 1. For any $z$ with $|z|&lt;1$ the only other point $w$ with $f(z)=f(w)$ is $w=1-z$, which necessarily has $|w|&gt;1$, and any neighborhood of $1$ has two distinct points which get sent to the same value under $f$."/></problem></q19_1>
