<problem><p>Give the largest disc centered at the origin for which \(f(z)=z^2+z\) is injective.</p></problem><solution><p>First, note that \(f&apos;(z)=2z+1\). \(f\) will certainly be not injective near \(a\) if \(f&apos;(a)=0\), that is because the degree of \(f\) will be larger than 1. \(f&apos;(a)=0\iff a=\frac{-1}{2}\), so an upper bound on the radius is \(\frac{1}{2}\). To show that the answer is actually \(\frac{1}{2}\), let&apos;s look at the outputs of \(f\) . If \(f(z)=c\) then</p><p>\[z^2+z=c\]</p><p>\[z^2+z-c=0\]</p><p> </p><p>\[z=\frac{-1\pm\sqrt{1+4c}}{2}=\frac{1}{2}\pm c&apos;\]</p><p> These two roots are on opposite sides of \(\frac{1}{2}\). If one occurs inside the disc \(|z|&lt;\frac{1}{2}\), then the other will occur outside the disc. Thus \(f\) is injective on the disc \(|z|&lt;\frac{1}{2}\).</p></solution><topics><Degree/></topics><instructors><c/></instructors>
