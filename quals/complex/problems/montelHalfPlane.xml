<montelHalfPlane><problem tex="Suppose $\Omega$ is a domain and $\{f_n\}$ is a sequence of holomorphic functions from $\Omega$ to the upper half plane. Suppose further that there is some $a\in\Omega$ such that $f_n(a)=f_k(a)$ for all $n,k$. Show that there is a holomorphic function $f$ from $\Omega$ to the half plane and a subsequence $k$ of $n$ such that $f_k\to f$. Is the same result true if we drop the requirement of $a$?" solutionCompleteness="full" questionViability="bad"><instructors><e/></instructors><topics><OpenMappingTheorem/><SequenceOfFunctions/><MobiusTransformation/><Montel/></topics><solution tex="First fix the biholomorphism&#xA;\[m(z)=\frac{z-i}{z+i}\]&#xA;from the half plane to the disc. Then the sequence $\{m\circ f_n\}$ is a sequence of uniformly bounded holomorphic functions on $\Omega$, so by Montel's theorem $\{m\circ f_n\}$ is a normal family. That is, there is a function $g:\Omega\to\mathbb{C}$ which is the limit of a subsequence of $\{m\circ f_n\}$. Call this subsequence $f_k$ so that we can say $m\circ f_k\to g$. We know $g(\Omega)\subset\overline{\mathbb{D}}$ because $m\circ f_k\to g$. If there is an  $x\in\Omega$ for which $g(x)\in\partial\mathbb{D}$, then $g$ is not an open map and so must be constant. This contradicts the fact that $a$ was fixed by $\{f_n\}$, because $g(a)\in\mathbb{D}$ and if $g$ is constant it cannot also be that $g(x)\in\partial\mathbb{D}$. Thus $g$ maps into $\mathbb{D}$ and not its boundary. Then the subsequence $f_k$ converges to $g\circ m^{-1}$, a holomorphic map from $\Omega$ to the upper half plane.&#xA;If we drop the requirement of $a$ then the sequence $f_n(z)=ni$ provides a counterexample because no subsequence converges, and the sequence $f_n(z)=\frac{i}{n}$ converges to the constant function 0 but 0 does not map into the half plane, so there are two counterexamples."/></problem></montelHalfPlane>
