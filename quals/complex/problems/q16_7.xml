  <solution tex="See the theorem section for a detailed construction. The process is to use the fact that $\Omega\neq\mathbb{C}$ to obtain a point $a\notin\mathbb{C}$ so that we can translate $\Omega$ so that it does not contain the origin. Once we know we don't include $0$, we can define a branch of log and use the assumption of simply connected to show this is well-defined. We use this branch of log to define a square root function which is $\pm$ injective. The image under this square root must then not contain any pairs $\pm z$ by $\pm$ injectivity, so in particular the region does not contain an entire open set. Then we translate so that an entire neighborhood of the origin is disjoint from our region. Inverting with $\frac{1}{z}$ gives a nonconstant bounded function which ultimately started in $\Omega$."/>
