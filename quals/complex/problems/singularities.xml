<singularities><problem tex="Let $f$ be an entire function and let $g:\mathbb{C}^*\to\mathbb{C}$ be given by&#xA;\[g(z)=f\left(\frac{1}{z}\right).\]&#xA;Then $0$ is an isolated singularity of $g$.

We claim this makes $f$ bounded. Let $R&gt;0$ such that&#xA;\[|z|&gt;R\implies|f(z)-g(0)|&lt;1.\]&#xA;Then for all $|z|&gt;R$ we have $|f(z)|&lt;|g(0)|+1$, so $f$ is bounded for $|z|&gt;R$. The set $\overline{B_R(0)}$ is compact and $f$ is continuous, so $f$ is bounded there too. Thus $f$ is bounded and therefore constant by Liouville's theorem. For the reverse direction, if $f$ is constant then $g$ is constant so the singularity is trivially removable.&#xA;Now suppose the singularity of $g$ is a pole. Then $\lim_{z\to\infty}f(z)=\infty$. That is, $f$ extends to a holomorphic function from the Riemann sphere to itself. We know the only holomorphic functions from the Riemann sphere to itself are rational functions, and $f$ has no poles in $\mathbb{C}$, so $f$ must be a polynomial. The reverse direction, as in the previous case, is trivial.&#xA;Finally for the essential singularity case. By the Casorati-Weierstrass theorem, the image of any (punctured) neighborhood of $0$ under $g$ is dense because $g$ has an essential singularity there. The image of $g$ can differ from the image of $f$ by at most the single point $f(0)$, so the image of $B_R(z)^c$ under $f$ is also dense in $\mathbb{C}$. For each $n$, let&#xA;\[U_n=f\left(\overline{B_n(0)}^c\right).\]&#xA;Then each $U_n$ is an open dense set. By the Baire category theorem,&#xA;\[W=\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty U_n\]&#xA;is dense and, in particular, nonempty. Let $w\in W$. Then for every $n$ there is a point $y_n\in\mathbb{C}$ with $|y_n|&gt;n$ such that $f(y_n)=w$. There must be infinitely many distinct $y_n$ because no complex number has infinite modulus. This proves the forward direction. For the reverse direction, suppose there is such a $w$. The roots of $f-w$ must grow arbitrarily large as per the uniqueness principle because $f$ is not constant. Then the roots of $g-w$ must grow arbitrarily small. If the singularity at $0$ were removable, the uniqueness principle would show $g$, and hence $f$, to be constant, which is not the case. The singularity is certainly not a pole because $g$ vanishes arbitrarily close to 0, it cannot approach $\infty$ near 0. Thus the singularity is essential.&#xA;For the &quot;FTA,&quot; suppose $f$ is a nonconstant polynomial. Then the singularity of $g$ is a pole and hence not essential. We know $f$ to be nonconstant, so it must be that the preimage of any point (0 in particular) under $f$ is finite."/></singularities>
