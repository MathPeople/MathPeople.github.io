Suppose there is a point $a\in G$ with $u(a)\geq u(z)$ for all $|z-a|&lt;r$ where $r&gt;0$ is small enough that $|z-a|\leq r\implies z\in G$. By the mean value property,&#xA;\[u(a)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^\pi u(a+re^{it})dt\leq\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^\pi u(a)dt=u(a).\]&#xA;There is a fact in analysis that if a continuous function $\phi$ has $\phi\geq0$ and $\int\phi=0$ then $\phi=0$. This is proven by shwoing $\phi&gt;\delta&gt;0$ on a neighborhood of some point where $\phi&gt;0$. We use this fact on the integral&#xA;\[\int_{-\pi}^\pi u(a)-u(a+re^{it})dt=0.\]&#xA;The inside is nonnegative by the maximum assumption, so $u(a)=u(a+re^{it})$ for all $t$. This also works for any $r$ small enough that the ball of radius $r$ centered at $a$ fits in our region, so we have proven that $u$ is constant near $a$. Thus we have shown that $u$ satisfies the maximum principle.&#xA;Now that we know $u$ satisfies the maximum principle, let $a\in G$ and let $r&gt;0$ be small enough that the ball $B$ centered at $a$ of radius $r$ is in $G$. Let $v$ be the solution to the Dirichlet problem which agrees with $u$ on the boundary of $B$,&#xA;\[v(a+se^{i\theta})=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^\pi P_s(\theta-t)u(a+re^{it})dt.\]&#xA;Then $v$ is harmonic, so it satisfies the maximum principle as well. Moreover the function $u-v$ also satisfies the maximum principle.The function $u-v$ is constantly $0$ on the boundary of $B$, though, so $u-v\leq0$ inside $B$. The same argument shows $v-u\leq0$ inside $B$ as well, so $u-v=0$ in $B$. That is, $u=v$. Now we know $v$ is harmonic because that's the point of the Dirichlet problem, so $u$ is also harmonic at $a$. Repeating for any $a$ shows that $u$ is a harmonic function."/></q18_4>
