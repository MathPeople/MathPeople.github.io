  <solution tex="First we take the derivative of the assumed equation to get&#xA;\[f'(z)=e^{g(z)}g'(z)=f(z)g'(z).\]&#xA;That is, if $g$ exists then $g'=\frac{f'}{f}$. Thus we will construct an antiderivative of $\frac{f'}{f}$. Notice that $f$ never vanishes so $\frac{f'}{f}$ is an entire function. Therefore by Cauchy's integral theorem, for any loop $\gamma$ in $\mathbb{C}$,&#xA;\[\int_\gamma\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}dz=0\]&#xA;(We could also use the argument principle here -- the above integral is $2\pi i(Z-P)$ where $Z,P$ are the zeroes and poles of $f$, of which there are none).&#xA;From here we copy the proof of Morera's theorem. Let $a\in\mathbb{C}$ and choose a path $p_a$ from $0$ to $a$. Define&#xA;\[g(a)=\int_{p_a}\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}dz.\]&#xA;This definition is path independent by the above vanishing integral. We will show via difference quotient that $g'=\frac{f'}{f}$. For $x\in\mathbb{C}$ let $p_x(t)=tx$. For $x,y\in\mathbb{C}$ let $p_x^y(t)=(1-t)x+ty$, and use $+$ to represent path concatenation. Then&#xA;\[\lim_{h\to0}\frac{g(a+h)-g(a)}{h}=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{1}{h}\left(\int_{p_a+p_a^{a+h}}\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}dz-\int_{p_a}\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}dz\right)=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{1}{h}\int_{p_a^{a+h}}\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}dz\]&#xA;\[=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{1}{h}\int_0^1\frac{f'(a+th)}{f(a+th)}hdt=\lim_{h\to0}\int_0^1\frac{f'(a+th)}{f(a+th)}dt.\]&#xA;Convergence is uniform on compact sets, so limits come in and we get&#xA;\[=\int_0^1\frac{f'(a)}{f(a)}dt=\frac{f'(a)}{f(a)}.\]&#xA;Thus $g$ is holomorphic with derivative $\frac{f'}{f}$. Now we show this does what we want by showing $\frac{f}{e^g}$ is constant.&#xA;\[\left(\frac{f}{e^g}\right)'=\frac{f'e^g-f\left(e^g\right)'}{e^{2g}}.\]&#xA;The numerator is&#xA;\[f'e^g-f\left(e^g\right)'=f'e^g-fe^gg'=f'e^g-fe^g\frac{f'}{f}=0.\]&#xA;Thus $\frac{f}{e^g}$ is constant, so $f=\alpha e^g$ for some constant $\alpha$. We know $\alpha\neq0$, so take some $\beta$ such that $e^\beta=\alpha$. This is possible in the scope of this problem because $\alpha$ is just a number. Then $f=e^\beta e^g=e^{\beta+g}$.&#xA;The second part is just applying the result to the nonvanishing holomorphic function $z:\Omega\to\mathbb{C}$. The resulting $g$ is by definition a branch of log."/>
