Let $\omega$ be a holomorphic one form, which can also be thought of as a meromorphic one form with no poles on a compact Riemann surface $\Sigma_g$. Thus $Z=Z-0=2g-2\geq2$, as $g\geq2$. Thus the number of zeroes of $\omega$ is at least two. That must mean that $\omega$ vanishes somewhere."/></C4_5>
