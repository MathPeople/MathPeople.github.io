<problem><p>State the following, clearly and completely:</p><p>(a) The definition we have been using for a function \(f:U\to\mathbb{C}\) to be analytic on \(U\), where \(U\) is an open subset of \(\mathbb{C}\).</p><p>(b) Let \(\gamma:[a,b]\to\mathbb{C}\) be continuously differentiable, \(a,b\in\mathbb{R}, a&lt;b\). Let \(f:U\to\mathbb{C}\), an open subset of \(\mathbb{C}\) containing \(\gamma\). State the definition of</p><p>\[\int_\gamma f(z)dz.\]</p></problem><solution><p>a) (assuming this is a class which follows Conway) The function \(f:U\to\mathbb{C}\) is analytic at a point \(a\in U\) if \(f\) is \(C^1\) as a real-valued function and if</p><p>\[\lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}\]</p><p>exists, recalling that this limit is defined with neighborhoods in \(\mathbb{C}\). We call \(f\) analytic in \(U\) if it is analytic at every point in \(U\).</p><p>b) This integral, the path integral, is defined as a limit of Riemann sums. Let \(a=x_0&lt;x_1&lt;\cdots&lt;x_n=b\) be a partition of \([a,b]\). The corresponding Riemann sum is</p><p>\[\sum_{k=1}^nf(x_k)(x_k-x_{k-1})\]</p><p>The path integral is defined as the limit of these Riemann sums, taken as the mesh of the partitions goes to 0.</p></solution><topics><ElementaryDefinitions/></topics><instructors><d/></instructors>
