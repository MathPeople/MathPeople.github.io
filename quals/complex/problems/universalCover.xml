<universalCover><problem tex="Prove the following are equivalent for a region $\Omega$ and a holomorphic function $f:\Omega\to\mathbb{C}$:&#xA;1) $f$ is conformal (angle-preserving)&#xA;2) $f'$ never vanishes&#xA;3) $f$ is locally injective, meaning for all $a\in\Omega$ there is a neighborhood $U$ of $a$ on which $f$ is injective&#xA;4) There is a simply connected Riemann surface $M$, a conformal projection $F:M\to f(\Omega)$ (projection means surjective holomorphic map), and a conformal projection $p:M\to\Omega$ such that $F=f\circ p$"><instructors/><topics/></problem><solution tex=""/></universalCover>
