Because $f_n\to f$, we also get $f_n'\to f'$. Because $f'(a)\neq0$, by definition of limit eventually $f_n'(a)\neq0$ as well.&#xA;We will use Hurwitz's theorem. Because $f'(a)&gt;0$, we know $f\neq0$. Then Hurwitz's theorem gives us that for every point $x\in\Omega$, let $d_x$ be the multiplicity of $f$ at $x$. For every ball $B_x$ sufficiently small centered at $x$, eventually $|f_m^{-1}(f(x))\cap B_x|=d_x$ counting multiplicity.&#xA;Suppose $x\neq y\in\Omega$ and $f(x)=f(y)=z$. Then take two small balls $B_x$ and $B_y$ of $x,y$, small enough that they are disjoint and such that Hurwitz's theorem applies. Let $d_x,d_y$ be the multiplicities of $f$ at $x,y$. By Hurwitz's theorem, eventually $|f_m^{-1}(z)\cap B_x|=d_x$ and $|f_m^{-1}(z)\cap B_y|=d_y$. In particular, because $d_x+d_y\geq1+1=2$, we cannot have that $f_m$ are injective. This contradicts our injectivity assumption, so no such $x\neq y$ can exist."/></problem></q15_3>
