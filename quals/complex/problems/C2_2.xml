Let $C_j$ denote the boundaries of small discs containing $p_j$ in the the positive (counterclockwise) direction. We want to examine the complement of all these discs. Let $S$ = complement in $X$ of the union of all discs containing the poles $p_1$, $\cdots$, $p_m$. $S$ is a relatively compact region on $M$, that is, the closure of $S$ is compact and $\partial S = \{C_1 , \cdots , \ C_j \}$. Observe that when we restrict $\alpha$ to $S \cup \partial S$, $\alpha$ becomes a holomorphic one form since it has no poles there. Let $\tilde{\alpha} = \alpha |_{S\cup \partial S}$. Then by applying Stokes theorem and Cauchy's residue theorem, we get&#xA;\[0 = \iint_S d\tilde{\alpha} = \int_{\partial S}\tilde{\alpha} = \sum_{j=1}^m \int_{C_j}\alpha = 2\pi i\sum_{j=1}^m Res_{z=p_j}(\alpha)\]"/></C2_2>
