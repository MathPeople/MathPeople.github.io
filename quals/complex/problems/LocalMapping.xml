<LocalMapping><problem tex="Suppose $f:D\to\mathbb{C}$ is a nonconstant holomorphic map ($D$ is the unit disc), and suppose $f(0)=0$. Then there is a natural number $d$ such that $f(z)=z^dg(z)$, where $g$ is a holomorphic function and $g(0)\neq0$." solutionCompleteness="none" questionViability="bad"><instructors/><topics/><solution tex="This is a consequence of the fact that holomorphic maps are analytic, as this is just a property of analytic functions. Proving it involves simply factoring out powers of $z$ until the first coefficient in the power series is nonzero.&#xA;This easily extends to any holomorphic function, it is just easier to state it in this way. Given any holomorphic function and any point, use translations and scalings to get this version to apply.&#xA;This is called the local mapping theorem because it immediately extends to Riemann surfaces, where the statement is that any holomorphic function $f$ between two Riemann surfaces can, at any point on the surface, be given in coordinates chosen so that the representative of $f$ is simply $z^d$."/></problem></LocalMapping>
