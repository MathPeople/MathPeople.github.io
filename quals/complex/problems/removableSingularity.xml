<removableSingularity><problem tex="Let $f:\mathbb{D}^*\to\mathbb{D}$ be holomorphic. Prove (without using the classification of removable singularities) that $f$ extends to a holomorphic function from $\mathbb{D}\to\mathbb{D}$."><solutionCompleteness><full/></solutionCompleteness><instructors><e/></instructors><topics><FunctionBounds/><Degree/><ClassificationOfSingularities/><HolomorphicMeansAnalytic/></topics></problem><solution tex="Because $f$ is bounded, the function $g$ defined as $g(z)=z^2f(z)$ is continuous at the origin, vanishing at $0$. Taking the difference quotient gives&#xA;\[\lim_{h\to0}\frac{h^2f(h)}{h}=0\]&#xA;That is, by definition $g'(0)=0$. Therefore $g$ is holomorphic on the whole disc. Then the local mapping theorem, coordinate-free version states that $f$ is holomorphic on the disc because of how $g$ is represented and because $g$ and $g'$ vanish at the origin."/></removableSingularity>
