We claim that this gives an isomorphism of vector spaces between $H_X^{\;1,1}$ and $\mathbb{C}$. To show $ev$ is well defined, suppose $[\rho] = [\tau]$. Then $\rho-\tau\in im\left(\overline{\partial}\right)$ by the way $H_X^{\;1,1}$ is defined. Let $\rho - \tau = \overline{\partial}f(z)dz$, this is possible because $\rho-\tau\in im\left(\overline{\partial}\right)$. By using Stokes theorem along with the fact $\partial f(z)dz = \frac{\partial f}{\partial z}dz\wedge dz=0$, we have&#xA;\[ev(\rho-\tau)=\int_X\overline{\partial}f(z)dz=\int_X dfdz=\int_{\partial X}f(z)dz=\int_{\emptyset}f(z)dz=0.\]&#xA;Hence the evaluation map is well defined. Also $ev$ is a linear map since integration is linear.&#xA;To show that $ev$ is surjective, recall (if you happen to have seen it before) that any orientable manifold admits a nowhere-vanishing volume form. Since $X$ is orientable, and volume forms for Riemann surfaces are $(1,1)$ forms (think $dz\wedge d\overline z$), let $\rho$ be a nowhere-vanishing volume form. Then $ev(\rho)\neq0$. We can rescale the integral by considering $a\rho$ for $a\in\mathbb{C}$ if need be to get any $c\in\mathbb{C}$, so $ev$ is surjective.&#xA;Now assume $ev(\rho) = 0$. We want to show $\rho \in im(\overline{\partial})$ so that $\rho = [0]$ in the cohomology class. Consider the equation given by $\overline{\partial}\partial f = \rho$. A fundamental PDE result says the existence of a solution to this equation happens iff $ev(\rho) = 0$. By assumption, we can find $\alpha = \partial f$ such that $\overline{\partial}\alpha = \rho$. Thus $\rho \in im(\overline{\partial})$, hence $\rho = [0]$. Thus the map is injective. Thus the spaces are isomorphic."/></problem></q19_8>
