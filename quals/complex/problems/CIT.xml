<CIT><problem tex="Let $\Omega$ be a region in $\mathbb{C}$, and let $f:\Omega\to\mathbb{C}$ be a holomorphic function. To be precise, let $f$ be $C^1$ which satisfies the Cauchy Riemann equations. Suppose $\gamma$ is a closed curve in $\Omega$ such that the entire interior of $\gamma$ lies within $\Omega$.

The proof in this case is just an application of Green's theorem using the Cauchy Riemann equations, change the line integral to a surface integral with Green's theorem and the inside vanishes by the Cauchy Riemann equations. Extend to the general case by modifying the curve $\gamma$ so that it encircles a whole bunch of elementary regions, you can do this with finer and finer tilings by squares or a similar approach."/></CIT>
