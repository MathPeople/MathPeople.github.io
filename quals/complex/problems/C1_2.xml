  <solution tex="Let $f:M\to\mathbb{C}$ be a holomorphic function. Then since $f$ is continuous, we also know $|f|:M\to\mathbb{R}$ is continuous. Since $M$ is a compact Riemann surface and $|f|$ is continuous, there exists a point $p \in M$ where $|f|$ achieves a maximum at $p$. Let $U$ be a chart of $M$ containing the point $p$. Then by the maximum modulus principle, $f$ is constant on $U$. Take two distinct points $p \neq q \in M$. Since $M$ is path connected, there exists a path from $q$ to $p$. We may form an open cover of $M$ consisting of charts which cover the path joining $q$ to $p$. Since this path is compact, there exists a finite subcover. By the uniqueness/identity theorem for holomorphic functions, this implies $f$ is constant on all these charts. Since $p$ and $q$ are arbitrary, we can repeat this argument as many times as needed for the whole Riemann surface $M$. Thus $f(p) = f(q)$ for all $p$ and $q$. Thus $f$ is constant on all of $M$."/>
