<Rouche><problem tex="Let $\Omega$ be a region and $\gamma$ a simple closed curve in $\Omega$. Suppose $f,g:\Omega\to\mathbb{C}$ are holomorphic and suppose they do not vanish on $\gamma$. Assume that for all points $z$ on $\gamma$,&#xA;\[|f(z)|&lt;|g(z)|.\]&#xA;Then $g$ and $f+g$ have the same number of zeroes inside $\gamma$." solutionCompleteness="full" questionViability="bad"><instructors/><topics/><solution tex="The number of zeroes $Z$ of $g$ is given by the argument principle,&#xA;\[\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{g\circ\gamma}\frac{1}{z}dz.\]&#xA;That is, the number of zeroes of $g$ inside $\gamma$ is the number of times the image of $\gamma$ under $g$ winds around $0$. We are going to show that this number is the same for $g$ as it is for $f+g$.&#xA;By our assumption, $|f(z)|&lt;|g(z)|$ for all $z\in\gamma$. Take the straight line $tg(z)+(1-t)(f(z)+g(z))$ connecting $g(z)$ to $f(z)+g(z)$ for $0\leq t\leq1$. We will show this line does not pass through 0. For simpler notations, let $a=f(z)$ and $b=g(z)$. Then $|a|&lt;|b|$ and we are claiming that $tb+(1-t)(a+b)\neq0$ for all $0\leq t\leq 1$. By assumption, $g(z)\neq0$ because $|g(z)|$ must be in particular strictly positive. Thus our claim holds for $t=1$. If $t\neq1$ (so that $1-t&gt;0$),&#xA;\[|tb+(1-t)(a+b)|=|(1-t)a+b|=|b-(1-t)(-a)|\] \[\geq|b|-(1-t)|-a|=|b|-(1-t)|a|&gt;|b|-(1-t)|b|=t|b|\geq0.\]&#xA;The second-to-last inequality is strict (by assumption and the fact that $1-t&gt;0$), so overall this is a strict inequality, meaning the term we are interested in cannot be 0 because its norm is strictly positive.&#xA;Now that we have shown the straight line from $g(z)$ to $f(z)+g(z)$ does not pass through $0$ for any $z\in\gamma$, we consider the pointwise straight-line-homotopy between the curves $g\circ\gamma$ and $(f+g)\circ\gamma$. We have shown this homotopy never hits $0$, so it is a path homotopy in $\mathbb{C}\setminus\{0\}$ which is the domain on which $\frac{1}{z}$ is holomorphic. Thus by Cauchy's integral theorem (path homotopy version), the integrals below are the same.&#xA;\[\int_{g\circ\gamma}\frac{1}{z}dz=\int_{(f+g)\circ\gamma}\frac{1}{z}dz.\]&#xA;Then by the argument principle, the number of zeroes of $g$ and $f+g$ are the same."/></problem></Rouche>
