<problem><p>Let \(f(z)=\frac{e^z}{(z-\pi i)^6}\) and let \(\gamma\) be the counter-clockwise boundary of the square \(x,y=\pm4\). Evaluate \(\int_\gamma f(z)dz\).</p></problem><solution><p>\(f\) is a meromorphic function with a single pole at \(z=\pi i\). This pole is inside the region encircled by \(\gamma\), so we will apply Cauchy&apos;s integral formula. Note that Cauchy&apos;s integral theorem means that the integral will be the same over any curve which encircles \(\pi i\) once in the positive direction, so we don&apos;t need to worry about the fact that \(\gamma\) is a square. First recall Cauchy&apos;s integral formula for a holomorphic function \(g\):</p><p>\[g^{(n)}(z)=\frac{n!}{2\pi i}\int_\gamma\frac{g(w)}{(w-z)^{n+1}}dw\]</p><p>Setting \(n=5\), \(z=\pi i\), and \(g(z)=e^z\) gives </p><p>\[e^{(5)}(\pi i)=\frac{5!}{2\pi i}\int_\gamma\frac{e^w}{(w-\pi i)^6}dw\]</p><p> This we can calculate, </p><p>\[\int_\gamma\frac{e^w}{(w-\pi i)^6}dw=\frac{2\pi i}{5!}e^{\pi i}=-\frac{2\pi i}{5!}\]</p></solution><topics><CauchyIntegralFormula/></topics><instructors><c/></instructors>
