<theorem>Maximum Modulus Principle</theorem><problem><p>Let \(\Omega\) be a region, \(a\in\Omega\), and \(r>0\) such that \(\overline{B_r(a)}\subset\Omega\). Let \(f:\Omega\to\mathbb{C}\) be a holomorphic function. Suppose there is some \(z\in B_r(a)\) such that</p><p>\[|f(z)|=\sup_{w\in\overline{B_r(a)}}|f(w)|\]</p><p>Then \(f\) is constant.</p></problem><solution><p>Suppose \(f\) is nonconstant. Then, by the open mapping theorem, \(f\) is an open map. Open maps cannot have the property which is the assumption of this theorem. Justification of this claim is easiest with a few pictures, which are easier to go over in person than in text.</p></solution>
