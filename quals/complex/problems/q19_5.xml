  <solution tex="Clearly $f_n\to f$ on $A$, we will use a connectedness argument to show $A=G$. By Montel's theorem and the Arzela-Ascoli theorem the family $\{f_n\}$ is normal and hence equicontinuous.&#xA;Let $w$ be a limit point of $A$ in $G$ and let $\epsilon&gt;0$. By equicontinuity there is a $\delta&gt;0$ such that for all $n$, $|z-w|&lt;\delta\implies|f_n(z)-f_n(w)|&lt;\frac{\epsilon}{2}$. Because $f$ is continuous we can shrink $\delta&gt;0$ if necessary so that $|z-w|&lt;\delta\implies|f(z)-f(w)|&lt;\frac{\epsilon}{4}$. By definition of limit point there is an $a\in A$ with $|w-a|&lt;\delta$. Because $a\in A$ there is an $N&gt;0$ such that for $n&gt;N$ $|f_n(a)-f(a)|&lt;\frac{\epsilon}{8}$. Then for all $n&gt;N$&#xA;\[|f_n(w)-f(w)|=|f_n(w)-f_n(a)+f_n(a)-f(a)+f(a)-f(w)|&lt;\frac{7\epsilon}{8}&lt;\epsilon.\]&#xA;Therefore $f_n(w)\to f(w)$ so $A$ is closed. Now we show $A$ is open.&#xA;Let $a\in A$ and $\epsilon&gt;0$. Because $a\in A$ there is an $N&gt;0$ such that for all $n&gt;N$ we have $|f_n(a)-f(a)|&lt;\frac{\epsilon}{2}$. Take $\delta&gt;0$ small enough that $B_\delta(a)\subseteq G$ and the following estimates hold for all $z\in B_\delta(a)$ and all $n$:&#xA;\[|f_n(z)-f_n(a)|&lt;\frac{\epsilon}{4}\]&#xA;\[|f(z)-f(a)|&lt;\frac{\epsilon}{8}.\]&#xA;This is possible because $f$ is continuous and $\{f_n\}$ is an equicontinuous family. Then for all $z\in B_\delta(a)$ and $n&gt;N$,&#xA;\[|f_n(z)-f(z)|=|f_n(z)-f_n(a)+f_n(a)-f(a)+f(a)-f(z)|&lt;\frac{7\epsilon}{8}&lt;\epsilon.\]&#xA;Thus $z\in A$, so $A$ is open. Then $A$ is both closed and open in $G$, and $G$ is connected and $A$ is nonempty by assumption, so $A=G$. Thus $f_n\to f$ on all of $G$."/>
