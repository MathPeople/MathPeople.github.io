Fix a point $z_0\in\Omega$ and for any $w\in\Omega$ define $F(w)=\int_{p_w}f(z)dz$ where $p_w$ is a path starting at $z_0$ and ending at $w$. The definition of $F$ is independent of path because of the closed curve assumption. Then show that $F$ is an antiderivative of $f$. Do this directly with difference quotient, using the fact that $f$ is continuous.&#xA;\[\lim_{w\to z_0}\frac{F(w)-F(z_0)}{w-z_0}=\lim_{w\to z_0}\frac{1}{w-z_0}\int_{p_w}f(z)dz.\]&#xA;If $w$ is near enough to $z_0$, then $p_w$ can be taken to be the straight line $tw+(1-t)z_0$ for $0\leq t\leq1$.&#xA;\[=\lim_{w\to z_0}\frac{1}{w-z_0}\int_0^1f(tw+(1-t)z_0)(w-z_0)dt=\lim_{w\to z_0}\int_0^1f(tw+(1-t)z_0)dt.\]&#xA;If $w$ is close to $z_0$, then $f(tw+(1-t)z_0)$ will be close to $f(z_0)$.&#xA;\[\sim\lim_{w\to z_0}\int_0^1f(z_0)dt=f(z_0).\]&#xA;Thus the difference quotient of $F$ gives that $F'=f$. That, in particular, shows that $F$ is holomorphic. Derivatives of holomorphic functions are holomorphic, so $f$ is also holomorphic.&#xA;This theorem is proven by constructing a global antiderivative. We never used the fact that the antiderivative is global, however, so we can do the same construction to obtain a local antiderivative under the weaker assumption that we only force $\int_\gamma f(z)dz=0$ for closed curves $\gamma$ which only encircle points in $\Omega$, which is weaker because there are fewer of these than there are of all closed paths. This applies to non-simply-connected domains, as well. The only difference is that the antiderivative $F$ will only be locally defined."/></Morera>
