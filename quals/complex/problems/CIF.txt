<theorem>Cauchy Integral Formula</theorem><problem><p>This is different from the integral theorem. This one says that if \(f\) is a holomorphic function deifned on some region \(\Omega\), if \(a\in\Omega\), and if \(r>0\) is small enough that \(\overline{B_r(a)}\subset\Omega\) then for every \(w\) with \(|w-a|\lt r\),</p><p>\[f(w)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\partial\overline{B_r(a)}}\frac{f(z)}{z-w}dz\]</p></problem><solution><p>The proof relies on Cauchy's integral theorem. By that theorem, we can change the path of integration to be as small of a circle around \(w\) as we want without changing the value. As we get arbitrarily close to \(w\), \(f(z)\sim f(w)\) because \(f\) is continuous. Then we simply calculate \[\int_\gamma\frac{f(w)}{z-w}dz=2\pi if(w)\]to get what we want. The only technicalities are in the approximation \(f(z)\sim f(w)\). Recall the most important calculation of complex analysis, \(\int_{|z|=1}\frac{1}{z}dz=2\pi i\).</p><p>We can extend this, using the geometric series expansion of \(\frac{1}{z-w}\), to prove that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analyticity_of_holomorphic_functions">holomorphic functions are analytic</a>. With that we can get Cauchy's extended integral formula,\[f^{(n)}(w)=\frac{n!}{2\pi i}\int_{\partial\overline{B_r(a)}}\frac{f(z)}{(z-w)^{n+1}}dz\]</p></solution>
