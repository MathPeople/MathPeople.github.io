<Hurwitz><problem tex="Let $f_n$ be a sequence of holomorphic functions on a region $\Omega$. Supppose $f_n\to f$ uniformly on compact sets. Let $a\in\Omega$ and suppose $f$ has multiplicity $m$ at $a$. If the ball $B_a$ centered at $a$ is small enough, then eventually there will be $m$ points $x_i$ in $B_a$ (counting multiplicity, also the points can change with $n$ but there will eventually always be $m$ of them) for which $f_m(x_i)=f(a).$" solutionCompleteness="full" questionViability="good"><instructors/><topics/><solution tex="Choose $r&gt;0$ small enough that $f(z)\neq f(a)$ for any $0&lt;|z-a|\leq r$. This is possible by the uniqueness principle, the roots of a nonconstant holomorphic function are isolated. Take the function $\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)-f(a)}$. This is holomorphic on a thin annulus containing the circle $c=\{z:|z-a|=r\}$. On this annulus, $\frac{f_n'(z)}{f_n(z)-f(a)}\to\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)-f(a)}$ uniformly. Computing the integral for the argument principle gives&#xA;\[(2\pi i)m=\int_c\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)-f(a)}dz=\int_c\lim\frac{f_n'(z)}{f_n(z)-f(a)}dz=\lim\int_c\frac{f_n'(z)}{f_n(z)-f(a)}dz.\]&#xA;The last integral is, by the argument principle, $(2\pi i)$ times the number of times $f_n$ hits $f(a)$ in $B_r(a)$. That limit being $(2\pi i)m$ shows that eventually $f_n$ hits $f(a)$ $m$ times in the ball, which is the desired result."/></problem></Hurwitz>
