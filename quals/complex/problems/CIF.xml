  <problem tex="This is different from the integral theorem. This one says that if $f$ is a holomorphic function deifned on some region $\Omega$, if $a\in\Omega$, and if $r&gt;0$ is small enough that $\overline{B_r(a)}\subset\Omega$ then for every $w$ with $|w-a|\lt r$,&#xA;\[f(w)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\partial\overline{B_r(a)}}\frac{f(z)}{z-w}dz\]">

  <solution tex="The proof relies on Cauchy's integral theorem. By that theorem, we can change the path of integration to be as small of a circle around $w$ as we want without changing the value. As we get arbitrarily close to $w$, $f(z)\sim f(w)$ because $f$ is continuous. Then we simply calculate&#xA;\[\int_\gamma\frac{f(w)}{z-w}dz=2\pi if(w)\]&#xA;to get what we want. The only technicalities are in the approximation $f(z)\sim f(w)$. Recall the most important calculation of complex analysis, $\int_{|z|=1}\frac{1}{z}dz=2\pi i$.&#xA;We can extend this, using the geometric series expansion of $\frac{1}{z-w}$, to prove that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analyticity_of_holomorphic_functions&quot;&gt;holomorphic functions are analytic&lt;/a&gt;. With that we can get Cauchy's extended integral formula,&#xA;\[f^{(n)}(w)=\frac{n!}{2\pi i}\int_{\partial\overline{B_r(a)}}\frac{f(z)}{(z-w)^{n+1}}dz.\]"/>
