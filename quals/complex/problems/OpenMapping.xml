<OpenMapping><problem tex="Let $\Omega$ be a region and suppose $f$ is a nonconstant holomorphic function from $\Omega$. Then $f$ is an open map, meaning it takes open sets to open sets."><solutionCompleteness radio="none"><full/></solutionCompleteness><instructors/><topics/></problem><solution tex="This is an immediate corollary of the local mapping theorem because the function $z^d$ is an open map unless $d=0$, which is exactly when $f$ is constant. If you use the non-Riemann-surface version, then you need to also consider the fact that $g$ from the non-Riemann-surface version of the local mapping theorem is a local biholomorphism around the point you are considering."/></OpenMapping>
