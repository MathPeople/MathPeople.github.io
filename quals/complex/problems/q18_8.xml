  <solution tex="Let $X$ be our $S^2$ with some arbitrary complex structure. Let $R$ be the Riemann sphere, i.e. $S^2=\mathbb{C}\cup\{\infty\}$ with the standard charts $(S^2\setminus\{\infty\},z),(S^2\setminus\{0\},\frac{1}{z})$. Take a point $p\in X$. Take a chart $(U_p,\phi_p)$ such that $\phi_p(p) = 0$. Consider $f:U_p\to R$ where $f(z)=\frac{1}{\phi_p(z)}$. Since $\phi_p$ is a holomorphic chart, $f$ is a meromorphic function with only a simple pole at $p$ (note $f$ is not defined on all of $X$, just near $p$).&#xA;Let $\psi$ be a smooth cutoff function such that $\psi=1$ on a neighborhood around $p$, $0\leq\psi\leq1$ on $U_p$, and $\psi=0$ outside $U_p$. Now we can consider the product $\psi f:X \setminus\{p\}\to R$ as a function. Note that&#xA;\[\overline{\partial}(\psi f) = \overline{\partial}(\psi)f + \overline{\partial}(f) \psi = \overline{\partial}(\psi)f\]&#xA;by the product rule and the fact that $f$ is holomorphic on its domain iff $\overline{\partial}(f) = 0$. Let $\alpha = \overline{\partial}(\psi f)=\overline{\partial}(\psi)f$. Since $\psi = 1$ near $p$, we know $\overline{\partial}(\psi) = 0$ near $p$. Thus $\alpha=0$ near $p$, so it can be extended at $p$ to give a (0,1) form defined on all of $X$. &#xA;Recall our space $X$ has genus $0$. Therefore the dimension of the Dolbeault cohomology $H_X^{(0,1)}$ is $0$, meaning $H_X^{(0,1)}=0$. That means every $\overline\partial$ closed $(0,1)$ form is $\overline\partial$ exact. In our setting, that means $\alpha=\overline\partial(g)$ for some $(0,0)$ form (smooth function) $g$.&#xA;Now we have that $\alpha=\overline\partial(g)$ for a smooth function $g$. Define the function $\phi:X\to R$ by $\phi=\psi f-g$. Then&#xA;\[\overline\partial(\phi)=\alpha-\overline\partial g=0.\]&#xA;That means $\phi$ is a holomorphic map into $R$, i.e. a meromorphic function. Moreover, any poles of $\phi$ must come entirely from $\psi f$ because $g$ is a bounded smooth function ($g:X\to\mathbb{C}$ and $X$ is compact). That means that $\phi$ has a single pole of order 1, and it is at $p$. Because the degree of any holomorphic map is constant, the degree of $\phi$ as a holomorphic map into $R$ is constantly $1$. Thus $\phi$ is actually a bijection, meaning $\phi$ is a biholomorphism from $X$ to $R$."/>
