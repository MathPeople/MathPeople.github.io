  <solution tex="Choose a point $p \in X$ and let $A = \overline{\partial}\left(\frac{\beta}{z}\right) $ where $\beta$ is a smooth cut off function. So $A$ is a $(0,1)$ form defined globally on $X$ which is supported in an annulus around $p$. Define $\rho = \partial A$. First note that since $\overline{\partial}$ is a differential, we have $\overline{\partial}A = \overline{\partial}\; \overline{\partial}\left(\frac{\beta}{z}\right) = 0$. Thus by using Stokes theorem along with the fact that $A$ is compactly supported, we have \begin{align*} \iint_X \rho = \iint_X \partial A = \iint_X \partial A + \overline{\partial}A = \iint_X (\partial + \overline{\partial})A = \iint_X dA = \int_{\partial X} A = 0. \end{align*} By the fundamental PDE result applied to the real and imaginary parts of $\rho$, we can find a complex-valued function $g$ with $\partial \overline{\partial} g = \rho$ and with the real and imaginary parts of $g$ tending to $0$ at infinity of $X$. Define $\alpha$ to be the real 1-form \begin{align*} \alpha = (A - \overline{\partial}g) + (\overline{A} - \overline{\overline{\partial}g}). \end{align*} Note that $\overline{\overline{\partial}g}$ is a $(1,0)$ form so $\partial \overline{\overline{\partial}g}=0$. Hence by using the result, we have \begin{align*} d\alpha = (\partial + \overline{\partial})(A - \overline{\partial}g) + (\overline{A} - \overline{\overline{\partial}g}) &amp;= \partial A - \partial \overline{\partial}g + \overline{\partial}A - \overline{\partial}\; \overline{\partial}g + \partial \overline{A} - \partial \overline{\overline{\partial}g} + \overline{\partial}\; \overline{A} - \overline{\partial}\; \overline{\overline{\partial}g} \\ &amp;= \rho - \rho + 0 - 0 + 0 + 0 - 0 + \overline{\rho} - \overline{\rho} = 0 \end{align*} Since $X$ is simply connected by assumption, $H_{dR}^1(X, \mathbb{R}) = 0$. By this and the calculation that $d\alpha = 0$, we can find a real valued function $\psi$ with $\alpha = d\psi$. This means that $A = \overline{\partial} g + \overline{\partial} \psi$ by another calculation. Hence \begin{align*} \overline{\partial}(\frac{\beta}{z} - (g+\psi)) = 0 \end{align*} on $X \setminus \{ p\}$. Hence $f = \frac{\beta}{z} -( g + \psi)$ is a meromorphic function on $X$ with a simple pole at $p$, and the imaginary part of $f$ tends to zero at infinity on $X \setminus D$, where $D$ is an open disc about $p$, since $\psi$ is real valued. (Donaldson defines $f = g + \psi$, I think this might be a typo)."/>
