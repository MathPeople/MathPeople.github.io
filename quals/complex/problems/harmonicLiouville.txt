<problem><p>Prove Liouville&apos;s theorem for harmonic functions, that any bounded harmonic function defined on all of \(\mathbb{C}\) must be constant. What can you say of an entire function whose real part never vanishes?</p></problem><solution><p>Suppose \(u:\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{R}\) is a bounded harmonic function. Because \(\mathbb{C}\) is simply connected, we can find a harmonic conjugate and extend \(u\) to be the real part of an entire function \(f\). Because \(u\) is bounded, we can translate by a sufficiently large real number so that the real part of \(f\) never vanishes. We will show this is sufficient to prove \(f\) must be constant, answering both questions simultaneously.</p><p>Because the real part of \(f\) never vanishes, the image of \(f\) lies in either the right or left half plane. Either way there is a Mobius transformation which takes this image into the disc, which is bounded, so \(f\) must be constant by Liouville&apos;s theorem.</p></solution><topics><MobiusTransformation/><EntireFunction/><Harmonic/><Liouville/><HarmonicConjugate/></topics><instructors><e/></instructors>
