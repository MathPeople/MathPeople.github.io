<Liouville><problem tex="Any bounded entire functions is constant. With less jargon, if $f:\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}$ is holomorphic and bounded, so $|f(z)|\leq M \forall z\in\mathbb{C}$, then $f$ is constant." solutionCompleteness="full" questionViability="good"><instructors/><topics/><solution tex="Proof: there are several proofs, we will do the classic Cauchy estimate version. Personally I prefer to just prove Cauchy's estimate in the course of this proof, but because we just proved it we will use it without reproof.&#xA;Let $z\in\mathbb{C}, r&gt;0$. Because $f$ is entire, $f$ is defined on a region containing $\overline{B_r(z)}$. Cauchy's estimate on this region gives&#xA;\[|f'(z)|\leq\frac{M}{r}.\]&#xA;Repeating this argument for all $r&gt;0$ shows that $|f'(z)|\leq0$, so $f'(z)=0$. Repeating this argument for all $z$ shows that $f'=0$, which means $f$ is constant."/></problem></Liouville>
