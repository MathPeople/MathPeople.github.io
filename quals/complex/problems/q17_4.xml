First invert using $\frac{1}{z}$ to get the disc minus a half-line. Then take the square root to halve the angles of the domain, giving us half the unit disc. Translate so that one of the two corners is at the origin. Invert with $\frac{1}{z}$ to send the corner at the origin to $\infty$, obtaining a translated version of a single quadrant of the plane. Translate so we have a single quadrant. Square with $z^2$ to change a quadrant to a half plane, then do a standard Mobius transformation to go from a half plane to the unit disc."/></problem></q17_4>
