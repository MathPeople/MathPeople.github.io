We can use a Mobius transformation (itself a rational function) to alter $f$ so that $f(\infty)\neq0,\infty$. Moreover the composition of rational functions is rational, so we lose no generality in assuming $f(\infty)$ is a nonzero complex number. The degree is constant on nonconstant holomorphic functions between connected compact Riemann surfaces, let $d$ be the degree of $f$. Then there are $d$ roots $z_1,\cdots,z_d$ and $d$ poles $p_1,\cdots,p_d$ of $f$ counting multiplicity. Define $\tilde f$ so that&#xA;\[f(z)=\prod_{i=1}^d\frac{z-z_i}{z-p_i}\tilde f(z)\]&#xA;That is, $\tilde f$ is $f$ with its zeroes and poles factored out. Each factor $\frac{z-z_i}{z-p_i}$ approaches 1 as $z\to\infty$, and $f(\infty)$ is some complex number, so $\lim_{z\to\infty}\tilde f(z)$ is some nonzero complex number. Then $\tilde f$ is a bounded entire function, so by Liouville's theorem $\tilde f$ is constant. This makes $f$ a rational function."/></C1_6>
