Because $M$ is compact and $S^2$ is connected, $f$ is surjective (clopen argument). We can assume without loss of generality that $M$ is connected, if not then this proof applies to each connected component and the result is the same. Because $M$ is connected, the degree of $f$ is constant. That is $|f^{-1}(y)| = m$ for all $y\in f(M)=S^2$. This is precisely the statement that $f$ assumes every value the same number of times."/></C2_1>
