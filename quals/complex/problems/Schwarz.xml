  <solution tex="Consider the function $g(z)=\frac{f(z)}{z}$. By assumption, $0$ is a root of $f$ which means $g$ is holomorphic. The maximum modulus principle means that the maximum of $g$ occurs on its boundary. On the boundary $|z|=1$,&#xA;\[|g(z)|=\left|\frac{f(z)}{z}\right|=|f(z)|\leq1.\]&#xA;Thus for all $z\in\overline D$\[|g(z)|\leq1\]If $z\neq0$ then multiplying by $|z|$ gives&#xA;\[|f(z)|\leq|z|.\]&#xA;At $z=0$, $g(0)=f'(0)$ by definition of the difference quotient. Thus $|f'(0)|\leq1$. If equality holds in either case then $g$ is constant by the maximum modulus principle. That shows the result."/>
