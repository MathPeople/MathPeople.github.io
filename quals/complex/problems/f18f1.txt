<problem><p>Evaluate the integral \(\int_\gamma f(z)dz\) where \(\gamma\) is the positively-oriented unit circle and</p><p>\[f(z)=\ln\frac{z-1-i}{z+1+i}\]</p><p>Describe your branch cut.</p></problem><solution><p>We need to find the image of the unit circle under the Mobius transformation \(M(z)=\frac{z-1-i}{z+1+i}\). The unit circle is traced by the points \(1\mapsto i\mapsto-1\mapsto1\), which goes to the sequence</p><p>\[M(1)=\frac{-i}{2+i}=\frac{-1-2i}{5}\]</p><p>\[M(i)=\frac{-1}{1+2i}=\frac{-1+2i}{5}\]</p><p> </p><p>\[M(-1)=\frac{-2-i}{i}=-1+2i\]</p><p> </p><p>\[\frac{-1-2i}{5}\mapsto\frac{-1+2i}{5}\mapsto-1+2i\mapsto\frac{-1-2i}{5}\]</p><p> This is a circle which lies in the negative real plane, so we will use the branch of log associated to the angles \((0,2\pi)\). Note the orientation signifies that our disc gets sent to the interior of the circle, so the origin is not in the image of the unit disc under \(M\). The only poles of \(f\) which occur in the unit disc would be poles of \(M\), but \(M\) has no poles in the unit disc because the only pole is \(-1-i\), which is outside the unit disc. Thus \(f\) is holomorphic in the disc, so Cauchy&apos;s integral theorem says the integral vanishes.</p></solution><topics><BranchOfLog/><MobiusTransformation/></topics><instructors><c/></instructors>
