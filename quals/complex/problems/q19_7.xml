<q19_7><problem tex="(a) Show that any compact Riemann surface admits a branched cover over the Riemann sphere. (b) Let $M$ be a compact Riemann surface of genus 5. Suppose $F$ is a branched cover from $M$ to $S^2$. Prove that $R=2(4+r)$, where $R=$ the total ramification index of $F$ , $r=$ number of sheets of the cover." solutionCompleteness="none" questionViability="good"><instructors><c/></instructors><topics><RiemannSurfaces/></topics><solution tex=""/></problem></q19_7>
