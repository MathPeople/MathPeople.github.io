We will show $p$ must be constant.&#xA;If $p$ has no roots, then the function $\frac{1}{p}$ is entire. Either $p$ is a constant or $|p(z)|\to\infty$ as $|z|\to\infty$, either way $\frac{1}{p}$ is bounded. By Liouville's theorem, $\frac{1}{p}$ is constant. That is only possible if $p$ is also constant.&#xA;\[\]&#xA;By contrapositive, if we assume $p$ is nonconstant then $p$ must have a root."/></problem></FTA>
