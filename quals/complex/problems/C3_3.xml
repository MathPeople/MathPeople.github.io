  <solution tex="Given $n$ distinct points on $\Sigma$, we want to find a meromorphic function $\phi_1$ such that it has zeroes at all $x_i, i=2, \cdots, n$ and a pole at $x_1$. We are going to do this with the Riemann Roch formula. Consider the divisor $(m\geq0)$&#xA;\[D=mx_1-x_2-x_3-\cdots-x_n\]&#xA;Then if a meromorphic function $f$ has $-(f)\leq D$ it must be that $x_i$ is a zero of $f$ with order $\geq1$ for all $2\leq i\leq n$, and if $f$ has a pole it must be at $x_1$ and nowhere else. Moreover this pole will have order $\leq m$, but we don't actually need that for this problem. Now the Riemann Roch formula (skipped straight to the inequality) gives us &#xA;\[l(D)\geq\|D\|-g+1\]&#xA; We can compute $\|D\|$, it is $m-n+1$. Thus &#xA;\[l(D)\geq m-n-g+2\]&#xA; If $m\geq n+g-1$, then we have &#xA;\[l(D)\geq1\]&#xA; Thus the Riemann Roch formula applied to $D=(n+g-1)x_1-x_2-\cdots-x_n$ gives us that $l(D)\geq1$. Let $\phi_1\in L(D)$ be nonzero. Then $\phi_1$ is a meromorphic function on $M$ which takes $x_i$ to $0$ for all $2\leq i\leq n$. Because the degree of $\phi_1$ is constant, $\phi_1$ must also have poles. However the only option for a pole of $\phi_1$ is at $x_1$, so $\phi_1$ must have a pole at $x_1$ so $\phi_1$ is the function we claimed exists. &#xA; Consider $\psi_1 = \frac {\phi_1(z)}{\phi_1(z)+1}$. Then $\psi_1$ is a meromorphic function such that it takes the value 1 at $x_1$ and zero at the other points. Repeat this process for all the other points $x_2, \cdots , x_n$ to get $\psi_2 \cdots , \psi_n$. By letting $\psi(z) = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i\psi_i(z)$, we get a meromorphic function which sends $x_i$ to $w_i$ for each $i$."/>
