The fact that $\frac{f'}{f}$ and $\frac{g'}{g}$ agree on a set which has a limit point in $D$ means, by the uniqueness principle, that they agree on all of $D$. That is, $f'g=g'f$. Take the function $\frac{f}{g}$. It is holomorphic because again $g$ never vanishes. Its derivative is&#xA;\[\left(\frac{f}{g}\right)'=\frac{f'g-g'f}{g^2}=0.\]&#xA;Then $\frac{f}{g}$ is a constant $c$, so $f=cg$."/></q15_8>
