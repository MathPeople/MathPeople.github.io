<C3_4><problem tex="Let $M_g$ be a compact Riemann surface of genus $g$. Suppose $f:M_g\to S^2$ is a branched cover. Prove that $R_f = 2(g + r - 1)$, where $R_f$ is the total ramification index of $f$, and $r$ is the number of sheets of the cover." solutionCompleteness="full" questionViability="good"><instructors><a/></instructors><topics><Degree/><PointSetTopology/><RiemannSurfaces/><HurwitzFormula/><RamificationIndex/></topics><solution tex="Since $M_g$ and $S^2$ are compact Riemann surfaces and $f$ is holomorphic map, the Riemann Hurwitz formula gives us a way of relating the Ramification index $R_f$ and the Euler characteristic of each surface. Note that the degree of the map $f$ corresponds to the number of sheets of the cover, so $deg(f) = r$. The formula gives us \begin{align*} 2-2g_{M_g} = r(2-2g_{S^2}) - R_f \\ 2-2g = r(2-0) - R_f \\ R_f =2(r + g - 1) \end{align*} Thus the result is shown."/></problem></C3_4>
