Let $\omega$ be a holomorphic one form, which can also be thought of as a meromorphic one form with no poles on a compact Riemann surface $\Sigma_g$. Thus $Z = Z - 0 = 2g-2 \geq 2$, as $g \geq 2$. Thus the number of zeroes of $\omega$ is at least two. That must mean that $\omega$ vanishes somewhere."/></problem></C3_5>
