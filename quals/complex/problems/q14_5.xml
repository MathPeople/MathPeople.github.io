<q14_5><problem tex="Determine a Mobius transformation which maps the upper half of the unit disc to the first quadrant. Also, find a conformal map which maps the portion of the unit disc in the first quadrant biholomorphically to the upper half plane. Give an explicit function." solutionCompleteness="full" questionViability="good"><instructors><a/><b/></instructors><topics><MobiusTransformation/></topics><solution tex="The upper half of the unit disc can be described with four key points, $-1,0,1,i$. Following those points encircles the upper half of the unit disc in the positive direction. Also, the angles at each of the points are $\frac{\pi}{2}, \pi,\frac{\pi}{2},\pi$. Describing the first quadrant in the same way can be done with the four points $0,1,\infty,i$ which encircles the region in the positive direction with the same angles. Thus we want our transformation $f$ to have $f(-1)=0, f(0)=1, f(1)=\infty, f(i)=i$. By $f(\pm1)$, we must have&#xA;\[f(z)=\alpha\frac{z+1}{z-1}.\]&#xA;By $f(0)=1$, $\alpha$ must be $-1$. Thus &#xA;\[f(z)=-\frac{z+1}{z-1}.\]&#xA;Checking for $i$ gives &#xA;\[f(i)=-\frac{i+1}{i-1}=-\frac{(i+1)(i+1)}{(i-1)(i+1)}=-\frac{2i}{-2}=i\]&#xA;as we wanted. Thus $f$ is the mobius transformation which takes the upper half disc to the first quadrant. &#xA;For the second part, use $z^2$ first to change the first quadrant intersected with the unit disc into the upper half of the unit disc. This is conformal because $0$ is the only problematic point and $0$ is not in our domain. After that, use $f$ to get the first quadrant. Then square again to get the upper half plane. That is, our map $g$ is given by &#xA;\[g(z)=\left(f(z^2)\right)^2=\left(-\frac{i-iz^2}{z^2+1}\right)^2.\]"/></problem></q14_5>
