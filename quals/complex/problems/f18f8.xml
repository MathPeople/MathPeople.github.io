Cauchy's theorem states that for all closed piecewise smooth paths $\gamma:[a,b]\to G$,&#xA;\[\int_\gamma f(z)dz=0.\]&#xA;We will use this to construct an antiderivative of $f$. Fix a point $x\in G$. For arbitrary $z\in G$ let $p_z$ denote a piecewise smooth path in $G$ starting at $x$ and ending at $z$. Define $F$ by&#xA;\[F(z)=\int_{p_z}f(w)dw.\]&#xA;We need to check that this is well-defined. Suppose $p_z,p'_z$ are two paths in $G$ starting at $x$ and ending at $z$. Then the concatenation $\gamma$ of $p_z$ with the reverse of $p'_z$ is a loop in $G$, so by Cauchy's integral theorem&#xA;\[\int_{p_z}f(w)dw-\int_{p'_z}f(w)dw=\int_\gamma f(w)dw=0.\]&#xA;Thus $F$ is well-defined. $F$ is an antiderivative by construction but a detailed reasoning is given in the proof of Morera's theorem."/></problem></f18f8>
