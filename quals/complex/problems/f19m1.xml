We call $f$ analytic in $U$ if it is analytic at every point in $U$.&#xA;b) This integral, the path integral, is defined as a limit of Riemann sums. Let $a=x_0&lt; x_1&lt;\cdots&lt; x_n=b$ be a partition of $[a,b]$. The corresponding Riemann sum is&#xA;\[\sum_{k=1}^nf(x_k)(x_k-x_{k-1}).\]&#xA;The path integral is defined as the limit of these Riemann sums, taken as the mesh of the partitions goes to 0."/></f19m1>
