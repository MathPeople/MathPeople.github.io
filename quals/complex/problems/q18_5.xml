By the open mapping theorem, $f$ is an open map. Also $f$ is bounded on $G$ because $\Omega$ is a bounded region (bounded by $R&lt;\infty$). Thus $0$ is a removable singularity of $f$. Denote $\tilde f$ to be $f$ extended to the whole disc $D$. Then $\tilde f$ is also an open map, so $\tilde f(D)$ is open.&#xA;We claim that $\tilde f(D)=\Omega$, i.e. that $\tilde f(0)\notin\partial\Omega$. This is because $\tilde f(D)\setminus\Omega$ is either empty or contains the single point $\tilde f(0)$. Because it is impossible to add a single point to $\Omega$ such that the result is also open, it must be that $\tilde f(D)=\Omega$. That means there is some point $z_0\in G$ such that $\tilde f(0)=f(z_0)$.&#xA;This does not quite show that $f$ is not injective, we merely showed $\tilde f$ is not injective. However, the open mapping theorem implies that there are disjoint neighborhoods $U,V\subset D$ of $0,z_0$ such that $\tilde f(U)=\tilde f(V)$. Choosing any point $w\in\tilde f(U)\setminus\{\tilde f(0)\}$ gives two points $u\in U,v\in V$ with $f(u)=\tilde f(u)=w=\tilde f(v)=f(v)$. Thus $f$ is not injective."/></problem></q18_5>
