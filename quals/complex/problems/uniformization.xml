  <solution tex="Let $M$ be a simply connected, noncompact Riemann surface. Then $M$ is biholomorphic to either $\mathbb{C}$ or the unit disc. Because every Riemann surface has a universal cover, and that universal cover is either compact or not (if it is compact, then it must be the Riemann sphere), this theorem classifies all Riemann surfaces up to their universal cover."/>
