<problem><p>Prove Vitali&apos;s theorem: If \(G\) is a region and \(\{f_n\}\) is a locally bounded sequence of holomorphic functions on \(G\) with a holomorphic \(f\) on \(G\) such that</p><p>\[A=\{z\in G:\lim f_n(z)=f(z)\}\]</p><p>has a limit point in \(G\) then \(f_n\to f\).</p></problem><solution><p>Clearly \(f_n\to f\) on \(A\), we will use a connectedness argument to show \(A=G\). By Montel&apos;s theorem and the Arzela-Ascoli theorem the family \(\{f_n\}\) is normal and hence equicontinuous.</p><p>Let \(w\) be a limit point of \(A\) in \(G\) and let \(\epsilon&gt;0\). By equicontinuity there is a \(\delta&gt;0\) such that for all \(n\), \(|z-w|&lt;\delta\implies|f_n(z)-f_n(w)|&lt;\frac{\epsilon}{2}\). Because \(f\) is continuous we can shrink \(\delta&gt;0\) if necessary so that \(|z-w|&lt;\delta\implies|f(z)-f(w)|&lt;\frac{\epsilon}{4}\). By definition of limit point there is an \(a\in A\) with \(|w-a|&lt;\delta\). Because \(a\in A\) there is an \(N&gt;0\) such that for \(n&gt;N\) \(|f_n(a)-f(a)|&lt;\frac{\epsilon}{8}\). Then for all \(n&gt;N\)</p><p>\[|f_n(w)-f(w)|=|f_n(w)-f_n(a)+f_n(a)-f(a)+f(a)-f(w)|&lt;\frac{7\epsilon}{8}&lt;\epsilon\]</p><p>Therefore \(f_n(w)\to f(w)\) so \(A\) is closed. Now we show \(A\) is open.</p><p>Let \(a\in A\) and \(\epsilon&gt;0\). Because \(a\in A\) there is an \(N&gt;0\) such that for all \(n&gt;N\) we have \(|f_n(a)-f(a)|&lt;\frac{\epsilon}{2}\). Take \(\delta&gt;0\) small enough that \(B_\delta(a)\subseteq G\) and the following estimates hold for all \(z\in B_\delta(a)\) and all \(n\):</p><p>\[|f_n(z)-f_n(a)|&lt;\frac{\epsilon}{4}\]</p><p>\[|f(z)-f(a)|&lt;\frac{\epsilon}{8}\]</p><p>This is possible because \(f\) is continuous and \(\{f_n\}\) is an equicontinuous family. Then for all \(z\in B_\delta(a)\) and \(n&gt;N\),</p><p>\[|f_n(z)-f(z)|=|f_n(z)-f_n(a)+f_n(a)-f(a)+f(a)-f(z)|&lt;\frac{7\epsilon}{8}&lt;\epsilon\]</p><p>Thus \(z\in A\), so \(A\) is open. Then \(A\) is both closed and open in \(G\), and \(G\) is connected and \(A\) is nonempty by assumption, so \(A=G\). Thus \(f_n\to f\) on all of \(G\).</p></solution><topics><FunctionBounds/><Montel/><SequenceOfFunctions/></topics><instructors><c/><f/></instructors>
