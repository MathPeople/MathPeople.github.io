  <solution tex="Let $M$ be the requested Riemann surface. Then $M$ is simply connected and noncompact, so by the uniformization theorem $M$ is biholomorphic to either $\mathbb{C}$ or $\mathbb{D}$. We provide examples for both.&#xA;Let $M_\mathbb{C}$ be given by the chart $\phi:U\to\mathbb{C}$ where $U=\mathbb{C}$ and $\phi(z)=\overline z$. Then $\phi$ is a homeomorphism so it can be extended to a holomorphically-consistent atlas. Clearly this atlas on $M_\mathbb{C}$ is incompatible with the identity chart because inserting the identity would make $\overline z$ a transition map, and that would make the atlas nonholomorphic. However $\overline z$ provides a biholomorphism from $M_\mathbb{C}$ to the standard structure on $\mathbb{C}$, so this agrees with the uniformization theorem.&#xA;We know that $\mathbb{C}$ and $\mathbb{D}$ are homeomorphic, we can provide an explicit homeomorphism by&#xA;\[\psi(re^{i\theta})=\frac{2}{\pi}\arctan(r)e^{i\theta}.\]&#xA;Extending the chart $(\mathbb{C},\psi)$ to a holomorphic atlas as before gives a complex structure on $M_\mathbb{D}$. Just like before, $\psi$ itself provides a biholomorphism from $M_\mathbb{D}$ to $\mathbb{D}$, again agreeing with the uniformization theorem."/>
