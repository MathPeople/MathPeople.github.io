Then $g(z)=\frac{1}{f\left(\frac{1}{z}\right)}$ is a holomorphic function from $\mathbb{C}^*$ into the bounded set $\left\{\frac{1}{\mathbb{D}+2}\right\}$. Because $g$ is bounded, $0$ is a removable singularity of $g$. That is, $f$ extends to a holomorphic function $F$ from the Riemann sphere to itself. We know $F(S^2)$ is compact because $F$ is continuous and $S^2$ is compact, and then $S^2$ is Hausdorff so $F(S^2)$ is therefore closed. If $F$ were nonconstant $F$ would be an open map, whereby $F(S^2)$ would be forced to be all of $S^2$. This cannot be the case because $F(S^2)$ is in the closure of $F(\mathbb{C})$ which is contained in a disc, and the closure of a disc cannot be the whole sphere. Thus $F$ is constant, making $f$ constant."/></openImpliesLiouville>
