It can be stated that every Riemann surface admits a universal cover which is one of these three spaces, or that every Riemann surface is a quotient of one of these spaces.&#xA;Suppose we have a holomorphic function $f:\mathbb{C}\to\Sigma_g$ where $g\geq2$. We know $\Sigma_g$ has universal cover the upper half plane, which is conformally equivalent to the disc. Recall the lifting criterion for covering spaces, $f$ will lift as a continuous function into $D$ if $f_*:\pi_1(\mathbb{C})\to\pi_1(\Sigma_g)$ satisfies $f_*(\pi_1(\mathbb{C}))\subseteq p_*(\pi_1(D))$, where $p$ is the projection map from $D$ to $\Sigma_g$. This condition is satisfied because both groups are simply the trivial group, so $f$ lifts as a continuous map. Now we claim $f$ actually lifts as a holomorphic map.&#xA;Given a continuous map, the property of being holomorphic at a point is a purely local one. Moreover, the projection map $p$ is locally a biholomorphism. That means (get ready for a mouthful) that for every point $z\in\mathbb{C}$ there is a neighborhood $U$ of $z$ for which $f(U)$ is a neighborhood in $\Sigma_g$ on which there is a holomorphic map $p^{-1}:f(U)\to D$ such that $p\circ p^{-1}=id_U$. The lift $\tilde f:\mathbb{C}\to D$ is defined to be $p^{-1}\circ f$ on $U$, that is how we construct lifts. Then $\tilde f$ is the composition of holomorphic maps on $U$, so $\tilde f$ is holomorphic at $z$. Then $\tilde f$ is a holomorphic map from $\mathbb{C}$ to $D$.&#xA;Lioville's theorem forces $\tilde f$ to be constant. Because $f=p\circ\tilde f$, $f$ is also constant. That is our required result."/></q18_7>
