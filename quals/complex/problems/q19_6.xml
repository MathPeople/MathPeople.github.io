  <solution tex="Let $a\in G$ and choose $r&gt;0$ small enough that $B_r(a)$ is compactly contained in $G$. Then $u$ has a harmonic conjugate on $B_r(a)$, so $u(z)=\Re(f(z))$ on $B_r(a)$. By the open mapping theorem $f$ is an open map, so $f(B_r(a))$ is open. Then $u(B_r(a))$ is also open. Thus $u$ is an open map."/>
