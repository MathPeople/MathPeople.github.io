Moreover, if there is a point $a\in G$ with $|f(a)|=\sup_G|f(z)|$, then $f$ must be constant on $\Omega$.&#xA;Let $B_r=\{z:|z|&lt;r\}$ and $C_r=\{z:|z|=r\}$. Then for all $r$ with $0\leq r&lt;R$, we know $\overline{B_r}\subset B_R$. By the maximum modulus principle,&#xA;\[\sup_{z\in B_r}|f(z)|=\sup_{z\in C_r}|f(z)|=M(r).\]&#xA;The left hand side clearly is a nondecreasing function of $r$ because $B_r$ is a larger set as $r$ gets larger. That shows that $M$ is nondecreasing. Moreover, if there are two points $r_1&lt;r_2$ for which $M(r_1)=M(r_2)$ then there is a point $a\in \overline{B_{r_1}}\subset B_{\frac{1}{2}(r_1+r_2)}$ with $|f(a)|=\sup_{B_{r_2}}|f(z)|$. By the maximum modulus principle, $f$ must then be constant on $B_{r_2}$. The uniqueness principle then forces $f$ to be constant on $B_R$.&#xA;The fact that $M$ is continuous follows from the fact that $f$ is continuous, but we will give some details there now. We already know that $M$ is an increasing function, we just need to show it does not jump. Let $0\leq s&lt;R$ and $\delta&gt;0$ be given. Let $\epsilon'&gt;0$ be small enough that $s+\epsilon'&lt;R$. Let $B=\{z:|z|&lt;s+\epsilon'\}$. Then $|f|:\overline{B}\to[0,\infty)$ is a uniformly continuous function (uniformly because of compactness). Let $\epsilon&gt;0$ be small enough that for any $z,w\in B$ with $|z-w|&lt;\epsilon$, $|f(z)-f(w)|&lt;\delta$. Also choose $\epsilon&lt;\epsilon'$. Now we show $M$ does not jump at $s$. For any $z$ with $s&lt;|z|&lt;s+\epsilon$, there is a $w$ with $|w|=s$ and $|w-z|&lt;\epsilon$. Then $|f(z)-f(w)|&lt;\delta$, so&#xA;\[|f(z)|-|f(w)|\leq|f(z)-f(w)|&lt;\delta\]&#xA;\[|f(z)|&lt;|f(w)|+\delta\leq M(s)+\delta\]&#xA;because $w\in C_s$. This last inequality shoes that for all $s'$ with $s&lt;s'&lt;s+\epsilon$,&#xA;\[M(s')&lt; M(s)+\delta.\]&#xA;Thus $M$ does not jump past $\delta$ at $s$. This is for all $\delta&gt;0$, so $M$ does not jump at $s$. This is for all $s$, so $M$ never jumps. Thus $M$ is continuous."/></problem></q15_9>
