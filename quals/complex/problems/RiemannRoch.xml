<RiemannRoch><problem tex="Let $M$ be a compact Riemann surface and let $f$ be a nonconstant meromorphic function on $M$, i.e. $f:M\to S^2$ is a holomorphic map. Given any point $p\in M$, let the integer $f_p$ be defined as&#xA;\[f_p=\begin{cases}0&amp;f(p)\neq0\text{ and }f(p)\neq\infty\\d&amp;p\text{ is a zero of }f\text{ of order }d\\-d&amp;p\text{ is a pole of }f\text{ of order }d\end{cases}\]&#xA;Then the expression \[\|f\|=\sum_{p\in M}f_p\] is well-defined because there are only finitely many $p$ where $f_p\neq0$, this is a consequence of the uniqueness theorem (so zeroes and poles are isolated) and the fact that $M$ is compact.&#xA;Consider the free abelian group $\langle M\rangle$ generated by the set $M$, alternately this is the free $\mathbb{Z}$ module generated by points in $M$. Elements of $\langle M\rangle$ are called divisors. The divisor $(f)\in\langle M\rangle$ associated to $f$ is defined to be \[(f)=\sum_{p\in M}f_pp\] Given any divisor $D$, $D$ takes the form \[D=\sum_{p\in M}d_pp\] where $d_p\in\mathbb{Z}$ and all but finitely many $d_p$ are $0$. We define \[\|D\|=\sum_{p\in M}d_p\] Given two divisors $D,D'$, we say $D\leq D'$ if $d_p\leq d'_p$ for all $p\in M$. Given two meromorphic functions $f,g$ on $M$, we have that $(f)\leq(g)$ if every zero of $f$ is also a zero of $g$ of at least as high a degree, and every pole of $g$ is also a pole of $f$ of at least as high a degree. Also, $-(f)=\left(\frac{1}{f}\right)$ because negating the divisor corresponds to swapping zeroes and poles, which is what inverting the function does as well.\[\]Given a divisor $D\geq0$, we want to define the quantity $l(D)$. First, consider the set $L(D)$ where elements of $L(D)$ are meromorphic functions $f$ on $M$ such that $-(f)\leq D$. This condition is a bound on how bad the poles at $f$ can be. Then $L(D)$ is a vector space over $\mathbb{C}$, because adding meromorphic functions and scaling cannot move poles and cannot introduce more poles. Then we define $l(D)$ to be the dimension of $L(D)$. We also want to mention that $l(K-D)$ represents the dimension of the vector space of holomorphic one-forms which must vanish at any point $p$ where $d_p&gt;0$, though we don't care so much about the details of this part.\[\]We are finally ready to state the Riemann Roch theorem. Suppose $D$ is a divisor on $M$ where $M$ has genus $g$. Then \[l(D)-l(K-D)=\|D\|-g+1\] In particular, $l(K-D)\geq0$ so \[l(D)\geq\|D\|-g+1\]\[\]Note that I have been using $\|D\|$ to mean what is commonly referred to as degree of $D$, or $deg(D)$. I was hoping to avoid confusion with degree of a function."><instructors/><topics/></problem><solution tex="We don't prove this."/></RiemannRoch>
