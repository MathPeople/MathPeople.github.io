  <solution tex="We will use Rouche's theorem, which states that if $|f|&lt;|g|$ on $\partial\Omega$ then $g$ and $f+g$ have the same number of roots in $\Omega$. First look at the function $e^z-3z^2=e^z+(-3z^2)$, we want the roots of this function. If $|z|=1$, then $|-3z^2|=3$. Also,&#xA;\[|e^z|=|e^{x+iy}|=|e^x|=e^x\]&#xA;and &#xA;\[\frac{1}{e}\leq e^x\leq e\]&#xA;for $-1\leq x\leq1$. Additionally, $e&lt;3$ so in particular $|e^z|\leq e&lt;3=|-3z^2|$. Now we know how many roots $-3z^2$ has in the unit disc, it has 2 (we have to count multiplicity). That means $e^z-3z^2$ has 2 roots in the unit disc. However, $e^z-3z^2$ has 2 roots on the real interval $(-1,1)$, we can prove this with the intermediate value theorem. If $h(x)=e^x-3x^2$ then &#xA;\[h(-1)=\frac{1}{e}-3&lt;0\] &#xA;\[h(0)=1&gt;0\]&#xA;\[h(1)=e-3&lt;0.\]&#xA;Thus $h$ has a (real) root between $-1$ and $0$ and another root between $0$ and $1$. These are the only roots of $e^z-3z^2$, as we already saw, by Rouche's theorem. The fact that they are real means they are solutions to $z=\overline z$, as required."/>
