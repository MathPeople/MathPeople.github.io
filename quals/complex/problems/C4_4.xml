  <solution tex="First recall that the universal cover of $\Sigma_g$ for $g \geq 2$ is the half-plane. This means we have a holomorphic (locally biholomorphic) covering map $p:\mathbb{H}\to\Sigma_g$. Suppose we have a holomorphic map $f:\mathbb{C}\to\Sigma_g$. Then, since $\mathbb{C}$ is simply connected, by the topological map lifting lemma we have a continuous function $F$ such that $f=p\circ F$. Since $p$ is locally biholomorphic, this means that $F=p^{-1}\circ f$ locally, and thus $F$ is holomorphic. Therefore we have a holomorphic function $F:\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{H}$.&#xA;(this proof is much clearer with a diagram but I can't draw those here yet) &#xA;\[\]&#xA; By the Riemann mapping theorem, there exist a biholomorphism $g:\mathbb{H}\to D$, the unit disk (this is also a simple Mobius transformation but why not use the Riemann mapping theorem since we can?). Thus $g\circ F$ is a holomorphic function from $\mathbb{C}$ to $D$. In other words, $|g\circ F(z)|&lt;1$ for all $z\in\mathbb{C}$ and is thus a bounded entire function. Thus $g\circ F$ is constant by Liouvilleâ€™s theorem. We know that $g$ is already a biholomorphism, so $F$ is constant. That means $f$ is constant as well."/>
