<theorem>Liouville's Theorem</theorem><problem><p>Any bounded entire functions is constant. With less jargon, if \(f:\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}\) is holomorphic and bounded, so \(|f(z)|\leq M \forall z\in\mathbb{C}\), then \(f\) is constant.</p></problem><solution><p>Proof: there are several proofs, we will do the classic Cauchy estimate version. Personally I prefer to just prove Cauchy's estimate in the course of this proof, but because we just proved it we will use it without reproof.</p><p>Let \(z\in\mathbb{C}, r>0\). Because \(f\) is entire, \(f\) is defined on a region containing \(\overline{B_r(z)}\). Cauchy's estimate on this region gives</p><p>\[|f'(z)|\leq\frac{M}{r}\]</p><p>Repeating this argument for all \(r>0\) shows that \(|f'(z)|\leq0\), so \(f'(z)=0\). Repeating this argument for all \(z\) shows that \(f'=0\), which means \(f\) is constant.</p></solution>
