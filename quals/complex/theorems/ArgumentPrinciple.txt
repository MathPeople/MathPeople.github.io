<theorem>Argument Principle</theorem><problem><p>Statement: Let \(\Omega\) be a region and suppose \(f\) is a meromorphic function on \(\Omega\). Let \(\gamma\) be a positively oriented simple closed curve which does not pass through any zeroes or poles of \(f\). Then</p><p>\[\int_\gamma\frac{f&apos;(z)}{f(z)}dz=(2\pi i)(Z-P)\]</p><p>where \(Z,P\) are the numbers of zeroes and poles of \(f\), respectively, which lie in the region bounded by \(\gamma\).</p><p>Note that by the chain rule (u-substitution),\[\int_\gamma\frac{f&apos;(z)}{f(z)}dz=\int_{f\circ\gamma}\frac{1}{z}dz\]is simply the winding number of the image of \(\gamma\) around the origin.</p></problem><solution><p>Factor the zeroes and poles of \(f\) to get \[f(z)=g(z)\prod_{i=1}^n(z-z_i)\prod_{j=1}^m\frac{1}{z-p_j}\] Here \(z_1,\ldots,z_n\) are the zeroes of \(f\) and \(p_1,\ldots,p_m\) are the poles. Note that \(g\) has no roots or poles inside \(\gamma\). Compute the logarithmic derivative of \(f\), not \(f&apos;\) directly: \[\frac{f&apos;(z_0)}{f(z_0)}=\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\ln(f(z))|_{z=z_0}\] \[\ln(f(z))=\ln(g(z))+\sum_{i=1}^n\ln(z-z_i)-\sum_{j-1}^m\ln(z-p_j)\] Then take the integral \[\int_\gamma(\ln(f(z))&apos;dz=\int_\gamma(\ln(g(z))&apos;dz+\sum_{i=1}^n\int_\gamma(\ln(z-z_i))&apos;dz-\sum_{j-1}^m\int_\gamma(\ln(z-p_j))&apos;dz\] \[=\int_\gamma\frac{g&apos;(z)}{g(z)}dz+\sum_{i=1}^n\int_\gamma\frac{1}{z-z_i}dz-\sum_{j=1}^m\frac{1}{z-p_j}dz\] Recall \(g\) has no poles or roots inside \(\gamma\), so \(\frac{g&apos;}{g}\) is a holomorphic function inside \(\gamma\). Thus by Cauchy&apos;s integral theorem \(\int_\gamma\frac{g&apos;(z)}{g(z)}dz=0\). The rest of the terms pick up a copy of \(2\pi i\) for each term because \(\int_{|z|=1}\frac{1}{z}dz=2\pi i\). Thus \[\int_\gamma\frac{f&apos;(z)}{f(z)}dz=0+\sum_{i=1}^n(2\pi i)-\sum_{j=1}^m(2\pi i)=2\pi i(n-m)\] which is the statement.\[\]Note that you can replace \(f(z)\) by \(f(z)-a\) to count poles and preimages of \(a\), just use the argument principle on \(g(z)=f(z)-a\).</p></solution>
