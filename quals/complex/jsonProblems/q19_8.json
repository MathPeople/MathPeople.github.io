    "solnTex": "First consider the evaluation map $ev:H_X^{\\;1,1}\\to\\mathbb{C}$ given by $ev(\\rho) = \\int_X \\rho$. We claim that this gives an isomorphism of vector spaces between $H_X^{\\;1,1}$ and $\\mathbb{C}$. To show $ev$ is well defined, suppose $[\\rho] = [\\tau]$. Then $\\rho-\\tau\\in im\\left(\\overline{\\partial}\\right)$ by the way $H_X^{\\;1,1}$ is defined. Let $\\rho - \\tau = \\overline{\\partial}f(z)dz$, this is possible because $\\rho-\\tau\\in im\\left(\\overline{\\partial}\\right)$. By using Stokes theorem along with the fact $\\partial f(z)dz = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z}dz\\wedge dz=0$, we have\\n\\[ev(\\rho-\\tau)=\\int_X\\overline{\\partial}f(z)dz=\\int_X dfdz=\\int_{\\partial X}f(z)dz=\\int_{\\emptyset}f(z)dz=0.\\]\\nHence the evaluation map is well defined. Also $ev$ is a linear map since integration is linear.\\nTo show that $ev$ is surjective, recall (if you happen to have seen it before) that any orientable manifold admits a nowhere-vanishing volume form. Since $X$ is orientable, and volume forms for Riemann surfaces are $(1,1)$ forms (think $dz\\wedge d\\overline z$), let $\\rho$ be a nowhere-vanishing volume form. Then $ev(\\rho)\\neq0$. We can rescale the integral by considering $a\\rho$ for $a\\in\\mathbb{C}$ if need be to get any $c\\in\\mathbb{C}$, so $ev$ is surjective.\\nNow assume $ev(\\rho) = 0$. We want to show $\\rho \\in im(\\overline{\\partial})$ so that $\\rho = [0]$ in the cohomology class. Consider the equation given by $\\overline{\\partial}\\partial f = \\rho$. A fundamental PDE result says the existence of a solution to this equation happens iff $ev(\\rho) = 0$. By assumption, we can find $\\alpha = \\partial f$ such that $\\overline{\\partial}\\alpha = \\rho$. Thus $\\rho \\in im(\\overline{\\partial})$, hence $\\rho = [0]$. Thus the map is injective. Thus the spaces are isomorphic.",
