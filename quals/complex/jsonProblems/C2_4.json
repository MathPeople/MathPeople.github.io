    "solnTex": "Let $\\mathcal{Z}$ denote the number of zeroes of $\\alpha$ and $\\mathcal{P}$ denote the number of poles of $\\alpha$ (counted according to multiplicities).\nThe idea is to modify the meromorphic one form $\\alpha$. We can't immediately apply the Hopf principle since $\\alpha$ might have poles. We want to create a smooth one form $\\tilde{\\alpha}$ which has only isolated zeroes. Let $\\omega = R(x,y)dx \\wedge dy$ be a volume form where $R > 0$, $|\\alpha|^2 = \\frac{1}{R}$. \n Now let $p$ be a pole of $\\alpha$. Choose a smooth real valued function $p:\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}$, such that $p(t) = 1$ for small $t$ and $p(t) = \\frac{1}{t}$ for large $t$. This is is essentially a bump function. Let $\\tilde{\\alpha} = p(|\\alpha|^2)\\alpha$. This is a smooth 1-form which is globally defined on $M$. Moreover, locally around the pole $p$: \n\\[\\tilde{\\alpha} = \\frac{1}{|\\alpha|^2}\\alpha = \\frac{R}{|f(z)|^2}f(z)dz = \\frac{R}{f(z) \\overline{f(z)}}f(z)dz =^* R(\\overline{\\frac{1}{f(z)}})dz\\]\n Note that $\\overline{\\frac{1}{f(z)}}$ tends to a zero with the same order as the pole. Moreover, the sign of the multiplicity also changes. This can be done for every pole of $\\tilde{\\alpha}$. Thus by the Hopf principle for this 1 form, we get \n\\[\\mathcal{Z} - \\mathcal{P} = -\\chi(M) = 2g-2\\]",
