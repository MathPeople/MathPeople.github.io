    "solnTex": "The singularity of the Mobius transformation $M(z)=\\frac{z-i}{z-1}$ happens at $z=1$, so we will probably not be able to get our radius of convergence to be greater than $1$. Let's see where the unit disc goes under $M$. We have a trace of the unit circle as $1\\mapsto i\\mapsto -1\\mapsto 1$, this maps to the sequence $\\infty\\mapsto0\\mapsto\\frac{1}{2}(1+i)\\mapsto\\infty$. That is, $M$ takes the positively oriented unit circle to the line $y=x$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ going upwards. Conformal maps preserve orientation, so the disc goes to the upper-left half plane. Then we can define a branch of log on the image under $M$, for $re^{i\\theta}=w=\\frac{z-i}{z+1}$ we have that $\\theta\\in(0,2\\pi)$ and\\n\\[\\ln(w)=\\ln(r)+e^{i\\theta}.\\]\\nIn terms of $z$ (where $|z|<1$), take $\\arg$ to output values in the interval $(0,2\\pi)$. Then\\n\\[\\ln\\left(\\frac{z-i}{z-1}\\right)=\\ln\\left|\\frac{z-i}{z-1}\\right|+i\\arg\\left(\\frac{z-i}{z-1}\\right).\\]\\nThere is a pole at $z=1$ for the Mobius transformation and a problem at $z=i$ because log cannot be extended to take in $0$. Therefore our largest ball is the unit disc.",
