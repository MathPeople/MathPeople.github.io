Using translations and rescalings we can assume, without loss of generality, that $G=\\mathbb{D}$, $a=0$, and there is some $M>0$ such that $|f(z)|<M$ for all $|z|<1$. Note $f'$ is defined on $\\mathbb{D}^*=\\mathbb{D}\\setminus\\{0\\}$. First we produce a bound for $f'$ near $0$. Let $a$ have $0<|a|<\\frac{1}{2}$ and let $\\gamma$ trace out the circle $|z-a|=\\frac{|a|}{2}$. By Cauchy's integral formula\n\\[|f'(a)|=\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\left|\\int_\\gamma\\frac{f(z)}{(z-a)^2}dz\\right|\\leq\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_\\gamma\\frac{|f(z)|}{|z-a|^2}|dz|\\leq\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\frac{M}{\\frac{|a|^2}{4}}2\\pi\\frac{|a|}{2}=\\frac{2M}{|a|}.\\]\nLet $g:\\mathbb{D}^*\\to\\mathbb{C}$ be defined by\n\\[g(z)=z^2f(z).\\]\nThen for any $z$ with $0<|z|<1$,\n\\[g'(z)=2zf(z)+z^2f'(z).\\]\nBy the bound produced above, $z^2f'$ and therefore $g'$ is continuous at $0$ (taking $0$ to $0$). Then $g$ is analytic on the disc. Moreover both $g$ and $g'$ vanish at the origin, so $g$ has a root of order at least 2 there. By the degree argument there is a natural number $d\\geq2$ and an analytic $h$ such that\n\\[g(z)=z^dh(z)\\]\non all of $\\mathbb{D}$. Then $f=z^{d-2}h$, so $f$ is analytic on $\\mathbb{D}$.",
