Moreover, $f(\\Omega)$ is open by the open mapping theorem, so $f''$ vanishes on an open set. The uniqueness principle states that $f''$ must then be constantly 0, so there are constants $a,b$ with\n\\[f(z)=az+b.\\]\nSolving the initial requirement is\n\\[az+b=a(az+b)+b=a^2z+ab+b\\]\n\\[a^2z-az+ab=0\\]\n\\[a(az-z+b)=0.\\]\nIf $a$ were 0, $f$ would be constant. Thus we have assumed $a\\neq0$. Then $az-z+b=0$ for all $z$. That is,\n\\[z(a-1)=-b.\\]\nIf $a\\neq1$ then this would state that the only complex number is $\\frac{-b}{a-1}$, a clear falsehood. Thus $a$ must be 1. This forces $b$ to be 0 and $f$ to be the identity.",
