    "solnTex": "On simply connected regions, harmonic functions have harmonic conjugates. Let $z\\in G$ and let $B$ be a ball around $z$ which is contained in $G$. On $B$, $u$ has a harmonic conjugate $v$ such that $f(z)=u(x,y)+iv(x,y)$ is holomorphic. Note that $f$ is only defined on $B$. However, smoothness is only a local property. Holomorphic functions are analytic and analytic functions are smooth, so $f$ is smooth. That forces $u$ to be smooth at $z$. This is true for all $z\\in G$, so $u$ is smooth.",
