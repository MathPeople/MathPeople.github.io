    "solnTex": "We will be hopelessly lost without knowing that $f(z):G\\to\\mathbb{C}$ is holomorphic if and only if $g(z)=\\overline{f(\\overline{z})}:\\overline{G}\\to\\overline{\\mathbb{C}}$ is holomorphic (all bars mean conjugate, no topological closures in this solution). Given this lemma, the assumption that $G=\\overline{G}$, and the fact that $D=\\overline{D}$, we get that both $f$ and $g$ are biholomorphisms from $G$ to $D$. Moreover, $g(a)=\\overline{f(\\overline{a})}=\\overline{f(a)}=\\overline{0}=0$ and we can show (my favorite is to use Jacobians but we will skip it for now) that $g'(a)=f'(a)>0$. The Riemann mapping theorem says there is only one biolomorphism from $G$ to $D$ with this behavior at $a$, so $f=g$.\nSweet, now let's show what we want. Our required result will hold if we can show that $z\\in G\\cap\\mathbb{R}\\iff f(z)\\in D\\cap\\mathbb{R}$. That is, $z=\\overline z\\iff f(z)=\\overline{f(z)}$.\n\\[\\implies\\]\nSuppose $z=\\overline z$. Then $f(z)=g(z)=\\overline{f(\\overline z)}=\\overline{f(z)}$.\n\\[\\impliedby\\]\nSuppose $f(z)=\\overline{f(z)}$. Then $\\overline{f(z)}=f(z)=g(z)=\\overline{f(\\overline z)}$. That is, $f(z)=f(\\overline z)$. Recall $f$ is, in particular, injective, so $z=\\overline z$.",
