    "solnTex": "Given $n$ distinct points on $\\Sigma$, we want to find a meromorphic function $\\phi_1$ such that it has zeroes at all $x_i, i=2, \\cdots, n$ and a pole at $x_1$. We are going to do this with the Riemann Roch formula. Consider the divisor $(m\\geq0)$\\n\\[D=mx_1-x_2-x_3-\\cdots-x_n\\]\\nThen if a meromorphic function $f$ has $-(f)\\leq D$ it must be that $x_i$ is a zero of $f$ with order $\\geq1$ for all $2\\leq i\\leq n$, and if $f$ has a pole it must be at $x_1$ and nowhere else. Moreover this pole will have order $\\leq m$, but we don't actually need that for this problem. Now the Riemann Roch formula (skipped straight to the inequality) gives us \\n\\[l(D)\\geq\\|D\\|-g+1\\]\\n We can compute $\\|D\\|$, it is $m-n+1$. Thus \\n\\[l(D)\\geq m-n-g+2\\]\\n If $m\\geq n+g-1$, then we have \\n\\[l(D)\\geq1\\]\\n Thus the Riemann Roch formula applied to $D=(n+g-1)x_1-x_2-\\cdots-x_n$ gives us that $l(D)\\geq1$. Let $\\phi_1\\in L(D)$ be nonzero. Then $\\phi_1$ is a meromorphic function on $M$ which takes $x_i$ to $0$ for all $2\\leq i\\leq n$. Because the degree of $\\phi_1$ is constant, $\\phi_1$ must also have poles. However the only option for a pole of $\\phi_1$ is at $x_1$, so $\\phi_1$ must have a pole at $x_1$ so $\\phi_1$ is the function we claimed exists. \\n Consider $\\psi_1 = \\frac {\\phi_1(z)}{\\phi_1(z)+1}$. Then $\\psi_1$ is a meromorphic function such that it takes the value 1 at $x_1$ and zero at the other points. Repeat this process for all the other points $x_2, \\cdots , x_n$ to get $\\psi_2 \\cdots , \\psi_n$. By letting $\\psi(z) = \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i\\psi_i(z)$, we get a meromorphic function which sends $x_i$ to $w_i$ for each $i$.",
