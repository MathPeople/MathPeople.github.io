To show that the answer is actually $\\frac{1}{2}$, let's look at the outputs of $f$ . If $f(z)=c$ then\n\\[z^2+z=c\\]\n\\[z^2+z-c=0\\]\n\\[z=\\frac{-1\\pm\\sqrt{1+4c}}{2}=\\frac{1}{2}\\pm c'.\\]\nThese two roots are on opposite sides of $\\frac{1}{2}$. If one occurs inside the disc $|z|<\\frac{1}{2}$, then the other will occur outside the disc. Thus $f$ is injective on the disc $|z|<\\frac{1}{2}$.",
