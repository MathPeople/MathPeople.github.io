Suppose $(U,\\phi)$ is a chart in $M$ and let $\\gamma$ be any closed path in $U$ not passing through the zeroes and poles of $f$. First note that $\\alpha := \\frac{f'}{f}dz$ is a meromorphic one form on the compact Riemann surface $M$. By the previous problem, we know that the sum of residues of $\\alpha$ is equal to zero. However, by Cauchys residue theorem and the argument principle, we have\\n\\[0=\\sum_{i=1}^nRes(\\alpha; k_i)n(\\gamma;k_i)=\\frac{1}{2\\pi i}\\int_{\\gamma}\\alpha=Z-P\\]\\nHence $Z=P$ which is the desired result.",
