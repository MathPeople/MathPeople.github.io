    "probTex": "Let $f$ be an entire function and let $g:\\mathbb{C}^*\\to\\mathbb{C}$ be given by\\n\\[g(z)=f\\left(\\frac{1}{z}\\right).\\]\\nThen $0$ is an isolated singularity of $g$. Prove the following classification of this singularity:\\nremovable $\\iff$ $f$ is constant\\npole $\\iff$ $f$ is a nonconstant polynomial\\nessential $\\iff$ $f$ is not constant and there is a $w\\in\\mathbb{C}$ for which $f^{-1}(w)$ is an infinite set\\nUse this to prove what I think should be called the fundamental theorem of algebra because it is more fundamental: Any nonconstant polynomial over $\\mathbb{C}$ has at most finitely many roots (to be clear, I think this statement with \\\"$\\mathbb{C}$\\\" replaced by \\\"any field\\\" is what should be called the FTA).",
    "solnTex": "If 0 is a removable singularity of $g$ then $\\lim_{z\\to\\infty}f(z)=g(0)$. We claim this makes $f$ bounded. Let $R>0$ such that\\n\\[|z|>R\\implies|f(z)-g(0)|<1.\\]\\nThen for all $|z|>R$ we have $|f(z)|<|g(0)|+1$, so $f$ is bounded for $|z|>R$. The set $\\overline{B_R(0)}$ is compact and $f$ is continuous, so $f$ is bounded there too. Thus $f$ is bounded and therefore constant by Liouville's theorem. For the reverse direction, if $f$ is constant then $g$ is constant so the singularity is trivially removable.\\nNow suppose the singularity of $g$ is a pole. Then $\\lim_{z\\to\\infty}f(z)=\\infty$. That is, $f$ extends to a holomorphic function from the Riemann sphere to itself. We know the only holomorphic functions from the Riemann sphere to itself are rational functions, and $f$ has no poles in $\\mathbb{C}$, so $f$ must be a polynomial. The reverse direction, as in the previous case, is trivial.\\nFinally for the essential singularity case. By the Casorati-Weierstrass theorem, the image of any (punctured) neighborhood of $0$ under $g$ is dense because $g$ has an essential singularity there. The image of $g$ can differ from the image of $f$ by at most the single point $f(0)$, so the image of $B_R(z)^c$ under $f$ is also dense in $\\mathbb{C}$. For each $n$, let\\n\\[U_n=f\\left(\\overline{B_n(0)}^c\\right).\\]\\nThen each $U_n$ is an open dense set. By the Baire category theorem,\\n\\[W=\\bigcap_{n=1}^\\infty U_n\\]\\nis dense and, in particular, nonempty. Let $w\\in W$. Then for every $n$ there is a point $y_n\\in\\mathbb{C}$ with $|y_n|>n$ such that $f(y_n)=w$. There must be infinitely many distinct $y_n$ because no complex number has infinite modulus. This proves the forward direction. For the reverse direction, suppose there is such a $w$. The roots of $f-w$ must grow arbitrarily large as per the uniqueness principle because $f$ is not constant. Then the roots of $g-w$ must grow arbitrarily small. If the singularity at $0$ were removable, the uniqueness principle would show $g$, and hence $f$, to be constant, which is not the case. The singularity is certainly not a pole because $g$ vanishes arbitrarily close to 0, it cannot approach $\\infty$ near 0. Thus the singularity is essential.\\nFor the \\\"FTA,\\\" suppose $f$ is a nonconstant polynomial. Then the singularity of $g$ is a pole and hence not essential. We know $f$ to be nonconstant, so it must be that the preimage of any point (0 in particular) under $f$ is finite.",
