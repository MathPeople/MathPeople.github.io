To do this, map a few points. $\\gamma$ follows $1\\mapsto i\\mapsto-1\\mapsto-i\\mapsto1$, this becomes\\n\\[-\\frac{3}{5}-\\frac{4}{5}i\\mapsto-\\frac{1}{3}\\mapsto-\\frac{3}{5}+\\frac{4}{5}i\\mapsto-3\\mapsto-\\frac{3}{5}-\\frac{4}{5}i\\]\\nNote the pole occurs at $-2i$, outside the region encircled by $\\gamma$.\\nRegardless of our branch of log, it will always be holomorphic if it can be defined. If we define our branch of log for $\\theta\\in(0,2\\pi)$ then our branch is defined on the interior of the image of $\\gamma$, so by Cauchy's integral theorem the integral vanishes.",
