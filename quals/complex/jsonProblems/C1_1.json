We can write the transition maps as $\\tilde{\\varphi} \\circ \\varphi^{-1} = \\mu(x,y) + i \nu(x,y)$. The Jacobian is a $2$ by $2$ matrix so we have\n\\[N := J(\\tilde{\\varphi} \\circ \\varphi^{-1}) = \\left[ {\\begin{array}{cc} \\frac{\\partial\\mu}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial \\mu}{\\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial\nu}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial\nu}{\\partial y} \\\\ \\end{array} } \\right]\\]\nFirst, note that since $M$ is a Riemann surface, the transition functions are holomorphic and therefore satisfy the Cauchy Riemann equations. Second, note that transition maps are nonsingular so the determinant is nonzero. Then we get \n\\[\\det(N) = \\frac{\\partial\\mu}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial\nu}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial\\mu}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial\nu}{\\partial x} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\mu}{\\partial x}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial\\mu}{\\partial y}\\right)^2 > 0 \\]\n Hence $M$ is orientable.",
