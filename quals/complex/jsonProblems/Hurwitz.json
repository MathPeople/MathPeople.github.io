If the ball $B_a$ centered at $a$ is small enough, then eventually there will be $m$ points $x_i$ in $B_a$ (counting multiplicity, also the points can change with $n$ but there will eventually always be $m$ of them) for which $f_m(x_i)=f(a).$",

Take the function $\\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)-f(a)}$. This is holomorphic on a thin annulus containing the circle $c=\\{z:|z-a|=r\\}$. On this annulus, $\\frac{f_n'(z)}{f_n(z)-f(a)}\\to\\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)-f(a)}$ uniformly.

That limit being $(2\\pi i)m$ shows that eventually $f_n$ hits $f(a)$ $m$ times in the ball, which is the desired result.",
