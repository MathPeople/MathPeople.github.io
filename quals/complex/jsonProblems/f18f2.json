Note that Cauchy's integral theorem means that the integral will be the same over any curve which encircles $\\pi i$ once in the positive direction, so we don't need to worry about the fact that $\\gamma$ is a square. First recall Cauchy's integral formula for a holomorphic function $g$:\n\\[g^{(n)}(z)=\\frac{n!}{2\\pi i}\\int_\\gamma\\frac{g(w)}{(w-z)^{n+1}}dw.\\]\nSetting $n=5$, $z=\\pi i$, and $g(z)=e^z$ gives \n\\[e^{(5)}(\\pi i)=\\frac{5!}{2\\pi i}\\int_\\gamma\\frac{e^w}{(w-\\pi i)^6}dw.\\]\nThis we can calculate,\n\\[\\int_\\gamma\\frac{e^w}{(w-\\pi i)^6}dw=\\frac{2\\pi i}{5!}e^{\\pi i}=-\\frac{2\\pi i}{5!}.\\]",
