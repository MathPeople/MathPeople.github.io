    "solnTex": "First we will show that $u$ satisfies the maximum principle. Suppose there is a point $a\\in\\Omega$ with $u(a)\\geq u(z)$ for all $|z-a|<r$ where $r>0$ is small enough that $|z-a|\\leq r\\implies z\\in\\Omega$. By the mean value property,\n\\[u(a)=\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_{-\\pi}^\\pi u(a+re^{it})dt\\leq\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_{-\\pi}^\\pi u(a)dt=u(a).\\]\nThere is a fact in analysis that if a continuous function $\\phi$ has $\\phi\\geq0$ and $\\int\\phi=0$ then $\\phi=0$. We use this on the integral\n\\[\\int_{-\\pi}^\\pi u(a)-u(a+re^{it})dt=0.\\]\nThe inside is nonnegative by the maximum assumption, so $u(a)=u(a+re^{it})$ for all $t$. This also works for any $r$ small enough that the ball of radius $r$ centered at $a$ fits in our region, so we have proven that $u$ is constant near $a$. Thus we have shown that $u$ satisfies the maximum principle.\nNow that we know $u$ satisfies the maximum principle, let $a\\in\\Omega$ and let $r>0$ be small enough that the ball $B$ centered at $a$ of radius $r$ is in $\\Omega$. Let $v$ be the solution to the Dirichlet problem which agrees with $u$ on the boundary of $B$,\n\\[v(a+se^{i\\theta})=\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_{-\\pi}^\\pi P_s(\\theta-t)u(a+re^{it})dt.\\]\nThen $v$ is harmonic, so it satisfies the maximum principle as well. Moreover the function $u-v$ also satisfies the maximum principle.The function $u-v$ is constantly $0$ on the boundary of $B$, though, so $u-v\\leq0$ inside $B$. The same argument shows $v-u\\leq0$ inside $B$ as well, so $u-v=0$ in $B$. That is, $u=v$. Now we now $v$ is harmonic because that's the point of the Dirichlet problem, so $u$ is also harmonic at $a$. Repeating for any $a$ shows that $u$ is a harmonic function.",
