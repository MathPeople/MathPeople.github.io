This one says that if $f$ is a holomorphic function deifned on some region $\\Omega$, if $a\\in\\Omega$, and if $r>0$ is small enough that $\\overline{B_r(a)}\\subset\\Omega$ then for every $w$ with $|w-a|\\lt r$,\\n\\[f(w)=\\frac{1}{2\\pi i}\\int_{\\partial\\overline{B_r(a)}}\\frac{f(z)}{z-w}dz\\]",
    "solnTex": "The proof relies on Cauchy's integral theorem. By that theorem, we can change the path of integration to be as small of a circle around $w$ as we want without changing the value. As we get arbitrarily close to $w$, $f(z)\\sim f(w)$ because $f$ is continuous. Then we simply calculate\\n\\[\\int_\\gamma\\frac{f(w)}{z-w}dz=2\\pi if(w)\\]\\nto get what we want. The only technicalities are in the approximation $f(z)\\sim f(w)$. Recall the most important calculation of complex analysis, $\\int_{|z|=1}\\frac{1}{z}dz=2\\pi i$.\\nWe can extend this, using the geometric series expansion of $\\frac{1}{z-w}$, to prove that <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analyticity_of_holomorphic_functions\\\">holomorphic functions are analytic</a>. With that we can get Cauchy's extended integral formula,\\n\\[f^{(n)}(w)=\\frac{n!}{2\\pi i}\\int_{\\partial\\overline{B_r(a)}}\\frac{f(z)}{(z-w)^{n+1}}dz.\\]",
