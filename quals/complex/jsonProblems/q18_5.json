    "solnTex": "Suppose $f:G\\to\\Omega$ is analytic and surjective, we will show $f$ is not injective. By the open mapping theorem, $f$ is an open map. Also $f$ is bounded on $G$ because $\\Omega$ is a bounded region (bounded by $R<\\infty$). Thus $0$ is a removable singularity of $f$. Denote $\\tilde f$ to be $f$ extended to the whole disc $D$. Then $\\tilde f$ is also an open map, so $\\tilde f(D)$ is open.\nWe claim that $\\tilde f(D)=\\Omega$, i.e. that $\\tilde f(0)\notin\\partial\\Omega$. This is because $\\tilde f(D)\\setminus\\Omega$ is either empty or contains the single point $\\tilde f(0)$. Because it is impossible to add a single point to $\\Omega$ such that the result is also open, it must be that $\\tilde f(D)=\\Omega$. That means there is some point $z_0\\in G$ such that $\\tilde f(0)=f(z_0)$.\nThis does not quite show that $f$ is not injective, we merely showed $\\tilde f$ is not injective. However, the open mapping theorem implies that there are disjoint neighborhoods $U,V\\subset D$ of $0,z_0$ such that $\\tilde f(U)=\\tilde f(V)$. Choosing any point $w\\in\\tilde f(U)\\setminus\\{\\tilde f(0)\\}$ gives two points $u\\in U,v\\in V$ with $f(u)=\\tilde f(u)=w=\\tilde f(v)=f(v)$. Thus $f$ is not injective.",
