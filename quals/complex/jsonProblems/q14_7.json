(a) Describe, no proof necessary, Perron's solution of the Dirichlet problem on $\\Omega$ for $f$. (b) Let $\\Omega$ be the punctured disc, $\\{z:0<|z|<1\\}$. Give a continuous function $f:\\partial\\Omega\\to\\mathbb{R}$ for which the Dirichlet problem is unsolvable and prove so.",
    "solnTex": "Perron's solution is to consider the class of functions which are subharmonic and which take values below the prescribed values. Specifically, let $S$ be the set of all functions $\\phi:\\overline\\Omega\\to\\mathbb{R}$ such that for all $x\\in\\partial\\Omega, \\phi(x)\\leq f(x)$ and for all $z_0\\in\\Omega$ holds the mean value sub-inequality\n\\[\\phi(z_0)\\leq\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_{-\\pi}^\\pi\\phi(z_0+re^{it})dt.\\]\nPerron's solution is then $\\psi$ where\n\\[\\psi(z)=\\sup_{\\phi\\in S}\\phi(z).\\]\nNow we move on to the second part. Let $f$ be the function defined on the boundary of $\\Omega$ by $f(z)=0$ if $|z|=1$ and $f(z)=1$ if $z=0$. We will prove this is unsolvable. We instead prove the slightly different (though sufficient) claim which is that any continuous function $u:\\overline{D}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ which is harmonic at all $z$ with $0<|z|<1$ and which vanishes on the unit circle must be constantly 0.\nSuppose we have such a function $u$. Because $u$ is continuous and $\\overline D$ is compact, $u(\\overline D)$ is bounded. Let $M$ be a bound so $|u(z)|\\leq M$ for all $|z|\\leq1$. Take any point $z_0\\in D^*$ where $D^*$ is the disc with the origin removed. Let $r\\in(0,|z_0|)$ and define $A_r=\\{z:r<|z|<1\\}$. The function $M\\frac{\\ln|z|}{\\ln r}$ is harmonic in $A_r$ and has boundary values of $0$ on the outer boundary $|z|=1$ and $M$ on the inner boundary $|z|=r$. Start with the bounded assumption on $u$, for all $z\\in A_r$,\n\\[-M\\leq u(z)\\leq M.\\]\nNow we can investigate bounds on $\\partial A_r$. Here we have the bounds\n\\[-M\\frac{\\ln|z|}{\\ln r}\\leq u(z)\\leq M\\frac{\\ln|z|}{\\ln r}.\\]\nThis comes from the fact that all three terms vanish on the outer boundary of $A_r$ and on the inner boundary we get the previous line of inequalities. Because both $u$ and $M\\frac{\\ln|z|}{\\ln r}$ are harmonic on the interior of $A_r$, these bounds extend to the interior of $A_r$. That is a result of the maximum/minimum principle of harmonic functions which states that the extrema of harmonic functions occur on the boundary. If we let $r\\to 0$ in the above bounds, $\\ln r\\to-\\infty$ meaning the outer terms vanish. Thus $u(z)=0$. Then $u(z)=0$ for all $z\\neq0$ by repeating the argument, and $u$ is continuous so it must also vanish at the origin. That proves our claim and ultimately shows that our previous function $f$ cannot admit a Dirichlet solution.",
