    "probTex": "We know the disc $\\mathbb{D}$ is a Riemann surface. We also know that taking the disc with its boundary and identifying the entire boundary, collapsing it to a single point, gives a sphere. Does this induce a complex structure on the resulting sphere compatible with the previous structure from just the interior of the disc?",
    "solnTex": "The answer is no, and we proceed with a contradiction. Let $X$ be the sphere constructed above and suppose this did induce a complex structure on $X$. We know that every sphere with a complex structure is biholomorphic to the Riemann sphere $S^2$, which is essentially the same construction but starting with $\\mathbb{C}$ instead of $\\mathbb{D}$. Let $f:X\\to S^2$ be a biholomorphism. Through the use of Mobius transformations, we can assume without loss of generality that $f$ takes the boundary-quotient point $p$ of $X$ to $\\infty\\in S^2$. Then $f$, being bijective, takes $X\\setminus\\{p\\}$ biholomorphically to $S^2\\setminus\\{\\infty\\}$. But $X\\setminus\\{p\\}=\\mathbb{D}$ and $S^2\\setminus\\{\\infty\\}=\\mathbb{C}$, and a biholomorphism between $\\mathbb{D}$ and $\\mathbb{C}$ contradicts Liouville's theorem.",
