    "solnTex": "Let $z_0\\in\\mathbb{C}$. Take the power series of $f$ centered at $0$,\\n\\[f(z)=\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}z^n.\\]\\nLet $R>0$ and rewrite the coefficients using Cauchy's integral formula,\\n\\[f^{(n)}(0)=\\frac{n!}{2\\pi i}\\int_{|w|=R}\\frac{f(w)}{w^{n+1}}dw.\\]\\nUsing the assumption that $|f(w)|< M|w|^\\alpha$ gives\\n\\[|f^{(n)}(0)|\\leq\\frac{n!}{2\\pi}\\int_{|w|=R}\\frac{MR^\\alpha}{R^{n+1}}|dw|=\\frac{n!M}{R^{n+1-\\alpha}}.\\]\\nNow $n\\geq0$ and $\\alpha<1$ so $n+1-\\alpha>0$. Thus $\\frac{n!M}{R^{n+1-\\alpha}}\\to0$ as $R\\to\\infty$. We are using the fact that $f$ is entire when we let $R\\to\\infty$. Thus $f^{(n)}(0)=0$ for all $n\\geq0$, meaning all coefficients in the power series are $0$, so $f$ is constantly 0.\\nNote that we showed $f=0$, which is stronger than $f$ is constant. That is because of the way this question is worded, in fact $|f(0)|\\leq M|0|^\\alpha=0$ so $f$ being constant implies that $f$ is $0$ under this bound.",
