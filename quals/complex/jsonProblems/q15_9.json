    "solnTex": "The maximum modulus principle states that if $f:\\Omega\\to\\mathbb{C}$ is holomorphic and $G$ is a region with $\\overline G\\subset\\Omega$ then the maximum of $f$ on $\\overline G$ occurs on $\\partial G$. Moreover, if there is a point $a\\in G$ with $|f(a)|=\\sup_G|f(z)|$, then $f$ must be constant on $\\Omega$.\nLet $B_r=\\{z:|z|<r\\}$ and $C_r=\\{z:|z|=r\\}$. Then for all $r$ with $0\\leq r<R$, we know $\\overline{B_r}\\subset B_R$. By the maximum modulus principle,\n\\[\\sup_{z\\in B_r}|f(z)|=\\sup_{z\\in C_r}|f(z)|=M(r).\\]\nThe left hand side clearly is a nondecreasing function of $r$ because $B_r$ is a larger set as $r$ gets larger. That shows that $M$ is nondecreasing. Moreover, if there are two points $r_1<r_2$ for which $M(r_1)=M(r_2)$ then there is a point $a\\in \\overline{B_{r_1}}\\subset B_{\\frac{1}{2}(r_1+r_2)}$ with $|f(a)|=\\sup_{B_{r_2}}|f(z)|$. By the maximum modulus principle, $f$ must then be constant on $B_{r_2}$. The uniqueness principle then forces $f$ to be constant on $B_R$.\nThe fact that $M$ is continuous follows from the fact that $f$ is continuous, but we will give some details there now. We already know that $M$ is an increasing function, we just need to show it does not jump. Let $0\\leq s<R$ and $\\delta>0$ be given. Let $\\epsilon'>0$ be small enough that $s+\\epsilon'<R$. Let $B=\\{z:|z|<s+\\epsilon'\\}$. Then $|f|:\\overline{B}\\to[0,\\infty)$ is a uniformly continuous function (uniformly because of compactness). Let $\\epsilon>0$ be small enough that for any $z,w\\in B$ with $|z-w|<\\epsilon$, $|f(z)-f(w)|<\\delta$. Also choose $\\epsilon<\\epsilon'$. Now we show $M$ does not jump at $s$. For any $z$ with $s<|z|<s+\\epsilon$, there is a $w$ with $|w|=s$ and $|w-z|<\\epsilon$. Then $|f(z)-f(w)|<\\delta$, so\n\\[|f(z)|-|f(w)|\\leq|f(z)-f(w)|<\\delta\\]\n\\[|f(z)|<|f(w)|+\\delta\\leq M(s)+\\delta\\]\nbecause $w\\in C_s$. This last inequality shoes that for all $s'$ with $s<s'<s+\\epsilon$,\n\\[M(s')< M(s)+\\delta.\\]\nThus $M$ does not jump past $\\delta$ at $s$. This is for all $\\delta>0$, so $M$ does not jump at $s$. This is for all $s$, so $M$ never jumps. Thus $M$ is continuous.",
