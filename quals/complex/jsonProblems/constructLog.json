    "probTex": "Suppose $\\Omega$ is simply connected and $f:\\Omega\\to\\mathbb{C}$ is holomorphic and never vanishes. Show that $f$ factors through $\\exp$, i.e. show there is a holomorphic function $g:\\Omega\\to\\mathbb{C}$ such that\n\\[f(z)=e^{g(z)}.\\]\nWe denote $g$ by $\\ln f$. Conclude that any simply connected domain which does not include the origin admits a branch of log.",
    "solnTex": "First we take the derivative of the assumed equation to get\n\\[f'(z)=e^{g(z)}g'(z)=f(z)g'(z).\\]\nThat is, if $g$ exists then $g'=\\frac{f'}{f}$. Thus we will construct an antiderivative of $\\frac{f'}{f}$. Notice that $f$ never vanishes so $\\frac{f'}{f}$ is an entire function. Therefore by Cauchy's integral theorem, for any loop $\\gamma$ in $\\mathbb{C}$,\n\\[\\int_\\gamma\\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}dz=0\\]\n(We could also use the argument principle here -- the above integral is $2\\pi i(Z-P)$ where $Z,P$ are the zeroes and poles of $f$, of which there are none).\nFrom here we copy the proof of Morera's theorem. Let $a\\in\\mathbb{C}$ and choose a path $p_a$ from $0$ to $a$. Define\n\\[g(a)=\\int_{p_a}\\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}dz.\\]\nThis definition is path independent by the above vanishing integral. We will show via difference quotient that $g'=\\frac{f'}{f}$. For $x\\in\\mathbb{C}$ let $p_x(t)=tx$. For $x,y\\in\\mathbb{C}$ let $p_x^y(t)=(1-t)x+ty$, and use $+$ to represent path concatenation. Then\n\\[\\lim_{h\\to0}\\frac{g(a+h)-g(a)}{h}=\\lim_{h\\to0}\\frac{1}{h}\\left(\\int_{p_a+p_a^{a+h}}\\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}dz-\\int_{p_a}\\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}dz\\right)=\\lim_{h\\to0}\\frac{1}{h}\\int_{p_a^{a+h}}\\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}dz\\]\n\\[=\\lim_{h\\to0}\\frac{1}{h}\\int_0^1\\frac{f'(a+th)}{f(a+th)}hdt=\\lim_{h\\to0}\\int_0^1\\frac{f'(a+th)}{f(a+th)}dt.\\]\nConvergence is uniform on compact sets, so limits come in and we get\n\\[=\\int_0^1\\frac{f'(a)}{f(a)}dt=\\frac{f'(a)}{f(a)}.\\]\nThus $g$ is holomorphic with derivative $\\frac{f'}{f}$. Now we show this does what we want by showing $\\frac{f}{e^g}$ is constant.\n\\[\\left(\\frac{f}{e^g}\\right)'=\\frac{f'e^g-f\\left(e^g\\right)'}{e^{2g}}.\\]\nThe numerator is\n\\[f'e^g-f\\left(e^g\\right)'=f'e^g-fe^gg'=f'e^g-fe^g\\frac{f'}{f}=0.\\]\nThus $\\frac{f}{e^g}$ is constant, so $f=\\alpha e^g$ for some constant $\\alpha$. We know $\\alpha\\neq0$, so take some $\\beta$ such that $e^\\beta=\\alpha$. This is possible in the scope of this problem because $\\alpha$ is just a number. Then $f=e^\\beta e^g=e^{\\beta+g}$.\nThe second part is just applying the result to the nonvanishing holomorphic function $z:\\Omega\\to\\mathbb{C}$. The resulting $g$ is by definition a branch of log.",
