Assume that for all points $z$ on $\\gamma$,\n\\[|f(z)|<|g(z)|.\\]\nThen $g$ and $f+g$ have the same number of zeroes inside $\\gamma$.\nProof: The number of zeroes $Z$ of $g$ is given by the argument principle, \n\\[\\frac{1}{2\\pi i}\\int_{g\\circ\\gamma}\\frac{1}{z}dz.\\]\nThat is, the number of zeroes of $g$ inside $\\gamma$ is the number of times the image of $\\gamma$ under $g$ winds around $0$. We are going to show that this number is the same for $g$ as it is for $f+g$.\nBy our assumption, $|f(z)|<|g(z)|$ for all $z\\in\\gamma$. Take the straight line $tg(z)+(1-t)(f(z)+g(z))$ connecting $g(z)$ to $f(z)+g(z)$ for $0\\leq t\\leq1$. We will show this line does not pass through 0. For simpler notations, let $a=f(z)$ and $b=g(z)$. Then $|a|<|b|$ and we are claiming that $tb+(1-t)(a+b)\\neq0$ for all $0\\leq t\\leq 1$. By assumption, $g(z)\\neq0$ because $|g(z)|$ must be in particular strictly positive. Thus our claim holds for $t=1$. If $t\\neq1$ (so that $1-t>0$),\n\\[|tb+(1-t)(a+b)|=|(1-t)a+b|=|b-(1-t)(-a)|\\]\n\\[\\geq|b|-(1-t)|-a|=|b|-(1-t)|a|>|b|-(1-t)|b|=t|b|\\geq0.\\]\nThe second-to-last inequality is strict (by assumption and the fact that $1-t>0$), so overall this is a strict inequality, meaning the term we are interested in cannot be 0 because its norm is strictly positive.\nNow that we have shown the straight line from $g(z)$ to $f(z)+g(z)$ does not pass through $0$ for any $z\\in\\gamma$, we consider the pointwise straight-line-homotopy between the curves $g\\circ\\gamma$ and $(f+g)\\circ\\gamma$. We have shown this homotopy never hits $0$, so it is a path homotopy in $\\mathbb{C}\\setminus\\{0\\}$ which is the domain on which $\\frac{1}{z}$ is holomorphic. Thus by Cauchy's integral theorem (path homotopy version), the integrals below are the same. \n\\[\\int_{g\\circ\\gamma}\\frac{1}{z}dz=\\int_{(f+g)\\circ\\gamma}\\frac{1}{z}dz.\\]\nThen by the argument principle, the number of zeroes of $g$ and $f+g$ are the same.",
