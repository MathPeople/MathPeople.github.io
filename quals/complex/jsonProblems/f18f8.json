Cauchy's theorem states that for all closed piecewise smooth paths $\\gamma:[a,b]\\to G$,\\n\\[\\int_\\gamma f(z)dz=0.\\]\\nWe will use this to construct an antiderivative of $f$. Fix a point $x\\in G$. For arbitrary $z\\in G$ let $p_z$ denote a piecewise smooth path in $G$ starting at $x$ and ending at $z$. Define $F$ by\\n\\[F(z)=\\int_{p_z}f(w)dw.\\]\\nWe need to check that this is well-defined. Suppose $p_z,p'_z$ are two paths in $G$ starting at $x$ and ending at $z$. Then the concatenation $\\gamma$ of $p_z$ with the reverse of $p'_z$ is a loop in $G$, so by Cauchy's integral theorem\\n\\[\\int_{p_z}f(w)dw-\\int_{p'_z}f(w)dw=\\int_\\gamma f(w)dw=0.\\]\\nThus $F$ is well-defined. $F$ is an antiderivative by construction but a detailed reasoning is given in the proof of Morera's theorem.",
