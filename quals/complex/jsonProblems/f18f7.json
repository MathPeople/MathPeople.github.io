    "solnTex": "Write $f$ as its Maclauren series,\n\\[f(z)=\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty\\frac{f^{(k)}(0)}{k!}z^k.\\]\nWe will estimate the terms $\\frac{f^{(k)}(0)}{k!}$ using Cauchy's integral formula. That formula is that\n\\[\\frac{f^{(k)}(0)}{k!}=2\\pi i\\int_\\gamma\\frac{f(z)}{z^{k+1}}dz\\]\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the circle of radius $R>0$. Then we can perform the estimate\n\\[\\left|\\frac{f^{(k)}(0)}{k!}\\right|=2\\pi\\left|\\int_\\gamma\\frac{f(z)}{z^{k+1}}dz\\right|\\leq2\\pi\\int_\\gamma\\frac{|f(z)|}{R^{k+1}}|dz|\\]\n\\[\\leq2\\pi\\int_\\gamma\\frac{MR^n}{R^{k+1}}|dz|=\\frac{4M\\pi^2}{R^{k-n}}.\\]\nFor any $k>n$, this will go to $0$ as $R\\to\\infty$ (this is where we use that $f$ is entire). That means all coefficients in the power series above $n$ vanish, so $f$ is a polynomial of degree no more than $n$.",
