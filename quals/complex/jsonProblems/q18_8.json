    "solnTex": "Let $X$ be our $S^2$ with some arbitrary complex structure. Let $R$ be the Riemann sphere, i.e. $S^2=\\mathbb{C}\\cup\\{\\infty\\}$ with the standard charts $(S^2\\setminus\\{\\infty\\},z),(S^2\\setminus\\{0\\},\\frac{1}{z})$. Take a point $p\\in X$. Take a chart $(U_p,\\phi_p)$ such that $\\phi_p(p) = 0$. Consider $f:U_p\\to R$ where $f(z)=\\frac{1}{\\phi_p(z)}$. Since $\\phi_p$ is a holomorphic chart, $f$ is a meromorphic function with only a simple pole at $p$ (note $f$ is not defined on all of $X$, just near $p$).\\nLet $\\psi$ be a smooth cutoff function such that $\\psi=1$ on a neighborhood around $p$, $0\\leq\\psi\\leq1$ on $U_p$, and $\\psi=0$ outside $U_p$. Now we can consider the product $\\psi f:X \\setminus\\{p\\}\\to R$ as a function. Note that\\n\\[\\overline{\\partial}(\\psi f) = \\overline{\\partial}(\\psi)f + \\overline{\\partial}(f) \\psi = \\overline{\\partial}(\\psi)f\\]\\nby the product rule and the fact that $f$ is holomorphic on its domain iff $\\overline{\\partial}(f) = 0$. Let $\\alpha = \\overline{\\partial}(\\psi f)=\\overline{\\partial}(\\psi)f$. Since $\\psi = 1$ near $p$, we know $\\overline{\\partial}(\\psi) = 0$ near $p$. Thus $\\alpha=0$ near $p$, so it can be extended at $p$ to give a (0,1) form defined on all of $X$. \\nRecall our space $X$ has genus $0$. Therefore the dimension of the Dolbeault cohomology $H_X^{(0,1)}$ is $0$, meaning $H_X^{(0,1)}=0$. That means every $\\overline\\partial$ closed $(0,1)$ form is $\\overline\\partial$ exact. In our setting, that means $\\alpha=\\overline\\partial(g)$ for some $(0,0)$ form (smooth function) $g$.\\nNow we have that $\\alpha=\\overline\\partial(g)$ for a smooth function $g$. Define the function $\\phi:X\\to R$ by $\\phi=\\psi f-g$. Then\\n\\[\\overline\\partial(\\phi)=\\alpha-\\overline\\partial g=0.\\]\\nThat means $\\phi$ is a holomorphic map into $R$, i.e. a meromorphic function. Moreover, any poles of $\\phi$ must come entirely from $\\psi f$ because $g$ is a bounded smooth function ($g:X\\to\\mathbb{C}$ and $X$ is compact). That means that $\\phi$ has a single pole of order 1, and it is at $p$. Because the degree of any holomorphic map is constant, the degree of $\\phi$ as a holomorphic map into $R$ is constantly $1$. Thus $\\phi$ is actually a bijection, meaning $\\phi$ is a biholomorphism from $X$ to $R$.",
