    "solnTex": "Because $f$ is bounded, the function $g$ defined as $g(z)=z^2f(z)$ is continuous at the origin, vanishing at $0$. Taking the difference quotient gives\\n\\[\\lim_{h\\to0}\\frac{h^2f(h)}{h}=0\\]\\nThat is, by definition $g'(0)=0$. Therefore $g$ is holomorphic on the whole disc. Then the local mapping theorem, coordinate-free version states that $f$ is holomorphic on the disc because of how $g$ is represented and because $g$ and $g'$ vanish at the origin.",
