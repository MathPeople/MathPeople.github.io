This can be computed directly using the Cauchy-Riemann equations, <a href=\\\"https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/151827/composition-of-a-harmonic-function-with-a-holomorphic-function-is-still-harmonic\\\">https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/151827/composition-of-a-harmonic-function-with-a-holomorphic-function-is-still-harmonic</a>.\nNow we answer a simpler question: show any nonnegative harmonic function $U$ defined on all of $\\mathbb{C}$ must be constant. Recall Harnack's inequality, it is stated below for a ball of radius $R$ centered at the origin and a point $re^{i\\theta}$ in the ball.\n\\[\\frac{R-r}{R+r}U(0)\\leq U(re^{i\\theta})\\leq\\frac{R+r}{R-r}U(0).\\]\nLetting $R\\to\\infty$ gives that $U(0)=U(re^{i\\theta})$, so $U$ is constant. In this problem, $U=u\\circ\\exp$ and $\\exp$ is surjective, so $U$ being constant forces $u$ to be constant.",
