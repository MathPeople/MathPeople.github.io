    "solnTex": "Clearly $f_n\\to f$ on $A$, we will use a connectedness argument to show $A=G$. By Montel's theorem and the Arzela-Ascoli theorem the family $\\{f_n\\}$ is normal and hence equicontinuous.\nLet $w$ be a limit point of $A$ in $G$ and let $\\epsilon>0$. By equicontinuity there is a $\\delta>0$ such that for all $n$, $|z-w|<\\delta\\implies|f_n(z)-f_n(w)|<\\frac{\\epsilon}{2}$. Because $f$ is continuous we can shrink $\\delta>0$ if necessary so that $|z-w|<\\delta\\implies|f(z)-f(w)|<\\frac{\\epsilon}{4}$. By definition of limit point there is an $a\\in A$ with $|w-a|<\\delta$. Because $a\\in A$ there is an $N>0$ such that for $n>N$ $|f_n(a)-f(a)|<\\frac{\\epsilon}{8}$. Then for all $n>N$\n\\[|f_n(w)-f(w)|=|f_n(w)-f_n(a)+f_n(a)-f(a)+f(a)-f(w)|<\\frac{7\\epsilon}{8}<\\epsilon.\\]\nTherefore $f_n(w)\\to f(w)$ so $A$ is closed. Now we show $A$ is open.\nLet $a\\in A$ and $\\epsilon>0$. Because $a\\in A$ there is an $N>0$ such that for all $n>N$ we have $|f_n(a)-f(a)|<\\frac{\\epsilon}{2}$. Take $\\delta>0$ small enough that $B_\\delta(a)\\subseteq G$ and the following estimates hold for all $z\\in B_\\delta(a)$ and all $n$:\n\\[|f_n(z)-f_n(a)|<\\frac{\\epsilon}{4}\\]\n\\[|f(z)-f(a)|<\\frac{\\epsilon}{8}.\\]\nThis is possible because $f$ is continuous and $\\{f_n\\}$ is an equicontinuous family. Then for all $z\\in B_\\delta(a)$ and $n>N$,\n\\[|f_n(z)-f(z)|=|f_n(z)-f_n(a)+f_n(a)-f(a)+f(a)-f(z)|<\\frac{7\\epsilon}{8}<\\epsilon.\\]\nThus $z\\in A$, so $A$ is open. Then $A$ is both closed and open in $G$, and $G$ is connected and $A$ is nonempty by assumption, so $A=G$. Thus $f_n\\to f$ on all of $G$.",
