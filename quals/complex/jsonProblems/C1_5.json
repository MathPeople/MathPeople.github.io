    "solnTex": "Let $f:X\\to S^2$ be the given meromorphic function. Since $f$ has only a single pole of order one, we know that the cardinality $|f^{-1}(\\infty)| = 1$, and by the degree theorem (degree is constant), $deg(f) = 1$. Therefore for any point $y \\in S^2$ there is exactly one point $x \\in f^{-1}(y)$. Hence $f$ is a bijective map. Note that $f^{-1}$ is also a continuous map since the image under $f$ of a closed set in $X$ is compact in $S^2$ and hence closed. This implies $f$ is a homeomorphism. By a corollary of the inverse function theorem, this implies $f^{-1}$ is also holomorphic. Hence $X$ is equivalent to $S^2$, by the biholomorphism $f$.",
