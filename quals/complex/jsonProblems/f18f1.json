Note the orientation signifies that our disc gets sent to the interior of the circle, so the origin is not in the image of the unit disc under $M$. The only poles of $f$ which occur in the unit disc would be poles of $M$, but $M$ has no poles in the unit disc because the only pole is $-1-i$, which is outside the unit disc. Thus $f$ is holomorphic in the disc, so Cauchy's integral theorem says the integral vanishes.",
