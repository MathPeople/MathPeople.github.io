Let $\\theta$ be a holomorphic one form on $X$. Observe that $f\\theta$ is a meromorphic one form on a compact Riemann surface. Thus by a previous homework problem (homework 2 problem 2), we know the sum of residues of $f\\theta$ is equal to 0. This is precisely the desired result. \n\\[\\impliedby\\]\n Assume that for any holomorphic one form $\\theta$, we have $\\sum_{i=1}^d\\langle T_i,\\theta(p_i)\\rangle=0$. Consider the $\\overline{\\partial}$ construction: \n\\[\\sum_{i=1}^d\\lambda_i\\overline{\\partial}\\frac{\\beta_i}{z-p_i}=[b]\\in H_X^{(0,1)}\\]\n Note that $\\langle b,\\theta\\rangle$ is definite and by our assumption, we know for any $\\theta$, $\\langle b,\\theta\\rangle=0$. Therefore $[b]=0$. This means $b=\\overline{\\partial}f$. By solving the $\\overline{\\partial}$ equation like before, we can find a meromorphic function with poles at each point in $D$.",
