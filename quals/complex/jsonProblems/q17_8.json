    "solnTex": "Let $C$ be the unit circle $|z|=1$. We will show that if a function $f:D^*\\to\\mathbb{R}$ is both harmonic and bounded and has $f(C)=0$ then it must be that $f=0$, in particular meaning that $f$ extends to all of $D$. Once we show that, we will relate it to the current problem.\\nLet $f:D^*\\to\\mathbb{R}$ be harmonic and suppose $|f(z)|\\leq M$ for all $0<|z|<1$ and that $f(z)=0$ for all $|z|=1$. Let $r$ be a real number with $0<r<1$ and consider the set $A_r=\\{z:r<|z|<1\\}$. Take the harmonic function $\\frac{M}{\\ln r}\\ln|z|$ on $A_r$. If $|z|=1$ then $\\frac{M}{\\ln r}\\ln|z|=0$, and if $|z|=r$ then $\\frac{M}{\\ln r}\\ln|z|=M$.\\nThe boundary of $A_r$ is $C\\cup C_r$ where $C_r=\\{z:|z|=r\\}$. On the boundary of $A_r$ hold the bounds\\n\\[-\\frac{M}{\\ln r}\\ln|z|\\leq f(z)\\leq\\frac{M}{\\ln r}\\ln|z|.\\]\\nThe maximum principle for harmonic functions extends these bounds to all of $A_r$. Let $z_0\\in D^*$. Then for all $0<r<|z_0|$ we have the bounds\\n\\[-\\frac{M}{\\ln r}\\ln|z_0|\\leq f(z_0)\\leq\\frac{M}{\\ln r}\\ln|z_0|.\\]\\nThe outer terms vanish as $r\\to 0$, which means $f(z_0)=0$. Thus $f$ is constantly $0$ on $D^*$. Moreover, $f$ extends to a harmonic function on $D$ because $f$ is constant. This proves our claim.\\nNow suppose $u$ is a bounded harmonic function on $D^*$. We know there is a harmonic function $v$ on all of $D$ which is equal to $u$ on $C$, this is the Dirichlet problem. We know $v$ is bounded because $\\overline{D}$ is compact and $v:\\overline{D}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ is continuous. Then the function $u-v$ is harmonic and bounded on $D^*$ and vanishes on $C$. By the previous work, $u-v=0$ on all of $D^*$ and therefore can be extended to be $0$ on all of $D$. Then $u=v$ on $D$, so $u$ is harmonic.",
