# MathPeople Website

This website is run from the MathPeople Github account, made and maintained by University of California, Riverside mathemathics graduate students. Check out the repository at <a href="https://github.com/MathPeople/MathPeople.github.io">https://github.com/MathPeople/MathPeople.github.io</a>.

### Math Problems & Test Prep

The current primary use is to compile studying resources and practice problems for UCR's core math courses. In particular, these were created to help prepare for the [written qualification exams](https://mathdept.ucr.edu/grads/apply/qualifying-exams). The subjects currently supported are listed in the navigation bar, and one can find lists of practice problems which can be searched by topic. 

Further, practice tests can be automatically generated using a fixed template. These can be very useful, but note that these are limited to only problems available on the website and the layout of the exam is fixed and may or may not represent the actual layout of an exam in a given year. (For a best approximation of what the actual written exam will look like review recent past quals, final/midterm exams, and hand-made practice exams.)

### Contributing

You can help make the website better! Type up problems/solutions in Latex and send these to the current maintainers of the website to get them implemented. If you notice an error in a problem or a solution (be it mathematical or typographic,) please let us know what and where so that it can be fixed.

If you are code savy, check out the Github repository. The <a href="https://github.com/MathPeople/MathPeople.github.io/wiki">wiki</a> has lots of information, though is currently out of date on the recent overhaul from XML to JSON problem formatting. 

### Current Development

The website is currently in development. Some functionality is still being implemented/created, and some features are not yet available due to internal format changes. Check back later, or speak to one of the current website maintainers. (See the active contributors on the Github page.)
