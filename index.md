# MathPeople site

This is the home site of the MathPople account, made and maintained by UCR math graduate students. Check out the repository at <a href="https://github.com/MathPeople/MathPeople.github.io">https://github.com/MathPeople/MathPeople.github.io</a>.

# Current Use

This site is intended to house any of the projects the MathPeople want to put online. Right now there is only the study guide application, designed for use in the qual prep seminars to help graduate students study for qualifying exams. The program is a study guide tool, essentially a collection of flashcard-like question/answer pairs organized into categories such as which topics are involved or how good of a test question it is.

The whole list of problems can be queried to show only specific types of problems, which may help with narrowing your studying, but the real purpose is the practice test generator. It is formatted by the instructor to choose certain types of questions and make a practice test out of them, and all you the student have to do is press the button for a new test and you will be given one. The questions are chosen at random according to a configuration created by the instructor; the instructor can make different types of tests for focusing on different parts of the material and for each type you the student can generate and take as many different practice tests as you like. The test is not adminstered through the website -- the practice test is intended to be taken at home on your own paper. The website only chooses the problems to give you.

The student accesses the material through the links above for whichever class you are in. The instructor uses the formatter to create and organize questions/solutions and practice test configurations. The <a href="https://github.com/MathPeople/MathPeople.github.io/wiki>wiki</a> has information on how to do this. Students are also welcome to type up problems or to write out solutions.
