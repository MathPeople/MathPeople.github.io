        <p>Welcome to the math project! The site this is hosted on is actually something I set up for a personal project, it just seems like a good medium to host this qual prep stuff too. Clicking the button below gets you to the project if you want to see it. It isn't a link. Clicking back on your browser won't get you back here, just refresh the page to get back here.</p>
        <button trigger="change page" page="intro">To check out the project</button>
        <p>I am still pretty new to writing websites so I am not quite confident that everything will work on the site. Also, the free service which hosts the site doesn't allow some functionalities so some stuff has to be done manually. I try to make that all clear when it comes up.</p>
        <div trigger="section" title="rendering test">
            <p>You should see the section head with a background of green and this section should be outlined in gold. Below is a math formula, check that it renders correctly. It is a rational function, it is not supposed to be the string 2x2-x3x4+1.</p>

            <p>A complex number is of the form \(z=a+bi\) for \(a,b\) real. The conjugate is \(\overline z=a-bi\). A useful calculation is that \(|z|^2=z\overline z=a^2+b^2\).</p>
            <p>Conjugation also plays a huge role in the differential geometry on complex manifolds, we saw this in part C. We can get to that later.</p>
            <p>Polar coordinates: \(x+iy=re^{i\theta}\). The most useful formula here is that \(x^2+y^2=r^2\), just draw the picture for everything else. Hopefully you are fluent with the unit circle.</p>
            <p>Know how analytic functions work. A function is analytic if it can be locally represented as a convergent power series. If an analytic function \(f:D\to\mathbb{C}\) has \(f(0)=0\) then it is possible to factor powers of \(z\) out of \(f(z)\) to get \(f(z)=z^ng\) where \(g(0)\neq0\), unless \(f=0\). Also analytic functions converge uniformly on compact sets and the root test (or ratio test) is how we tell where they converge. Analytic functions are smooth and the derivatives are given by termwise differentiation. Power series which converge do so uniformly on compact sets.</p>

        <div trigger="section" title="complex derivative">
            <p>The definition of derivative is the same, just in the universe of complex numbers instead of real numbers. It's still just the difference quotient.</p>
            <p>The first thing we do is obtain the Cauchy Riemann equations by computing the difference quotient along the real and imaginary axes.\[f(z)=f(x+iy)=u(x+iy)+iv(x+iy)\]\[f'(z)=\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(z)=\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(z)\]\[\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}=\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}+i\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}\]\[\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}=\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}-i\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}\]\[\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}=\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}\]\[\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}=-\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}\]</p>
            <p>Saying a function is holomorphic means the difference quotient converges at every point. That is immediately equivalent to the function admitting all partial derivatives and the partial derivatives satisfy the Cauchy Riemann equations. Holomorphic is not immediately equivalent to being continuous.</p>
            <p>If a function is both holomorphic and purely real (meaning \(f(z)\in\mathbb{R}\) for all \(z\)) then, by the Cauchy Riemann equations (because \(v=0\)), \(f\) is constant. This trick is sometimes useful to show a function must be constant.</p>
            <p>We have all seen that \(\mathbb{C}\ni a+bi=(a,b)\in\mathbb{R}^2\). Have you ever seen \(a+bi\) as a matrix, though? \[a+bi=\left(\begin{array}{cc}a&amp;b\\-b&amp;a\end{array}\right)\] Addition of matrices clearly gives addition of complex numbers and multiplying out \((a+bi)(c+di)\) gives the expected \((ac-bd)+(ad+bc)i\). \[\left(\begin{array}{cc}a&amp;b\\-b&amp;a\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{cc}c&amp;d\\-d&amp;c\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{cc}ac-bd&amp;ad+bc\\-ad-bc&amp;ac-bd\end{array}\right)\] Why do we care about this? Well, consider the map \(f(z):\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}\) as a function on \(\mathbb{R}^2\), \(f=u+iv\). Written actually in \(\mathbb{R}^2\), it becomes \[f(x,y)=(u(x,y),v(x,y))\] The Jacobian of this function is \[\left(\begin{array}{cc}\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}&amp;\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}\\\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}&amp;\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}\end{array}\right)\] Then \(f\) is holomorphic if its Jacobian is a complex number, meaning \(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}=\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}\) and \(\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}=-\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}\). </p><p>This interpretation really helps with conjugation. Remember the function \(\overline z\) is defined as \((a,b)\to(a,-b)\). The Jacobian of this map is \[\left(\begin{array}{cc}1&amp;0\\0&amp;-1\end{array}\right)\] Note that this does not match the pattern of complex numbers, that is one way of realizing conjugation is not holomorphic. However, let&apos;s prove a fact about conjugation.Let \(f:\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}\) be a function and define the function \(g:\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}\) as \[g(z)=\overline{f(\overline z)}\] The claim is that \(f\) is holomorphic if and only if \(g\) is holomorphic. To see this, let&apos;s compute the Jacobian of \(g\). Let \(c\) be the conjugation map, \(c(z)=\overline z\). Then \(g=c\circ f\circ c\). Then the Jacobian of \(g\) is \[\left(\begin{array}{cc}1&amp;0\\0&amp;-1\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{cc}\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}&amp;\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}\\\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}&amp;\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{cc}1&amp;0\\0&amp;-1\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{cc}\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}&amp;-\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}\\-\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}&amp;\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}\end{array}\right)\] This takes the form of a complex number if and only if the jacobian of \(f\) does, so that proves our claim.</p>

                <summary>Cauchy integral theorem</summary>
                <p>Let (\Omega\) be a region in \(\mathbb{C}\), and let \(f:\Omega\to\mathbb{C}\) be a holomorphic function. To be precise, let \(f\) be \(C^1\) which satisfies the Cauchy Riemann equations. Suppose \(\gamma\) is a closed curve in \(\Omega\) such that the entire interior of \(\gamma\) lies within \(\Omega\). Then \[\int_\gamma f(z)dz=0\]</p>
                <p>Proof: First prove it for elementary regions, regions which are both \(x\)- and \(y\)- simple. The proof in this case is just an application of Green's theorem using the Cauchy Riemann equations, change the line integral to a surface integral with Green's theorem and the inside vanishes by the Cauchy Riemann equations. Extend to the general case by modifying the curve \(\gamma\) so that it encircles a whole bunch of elementary regions, you can do this with finer and finer tilings by squares or a similar approach.</p>

            <details class="theorem">
                <summary>Goursat's theorem</summary>
                <p>The same as Cauchy integral theorem, but we drop the assumption of \(C^1\). That is, the only assumption we make on \(f\) is that its complex difference quotient converges at every point. We seek the same result as the Cauchy integral theorem.</p>
                <p>Proving it requires some direct analysis. We take the same approach as in the Cauchy integral theorem, by adding finer and finer grids into our region so we can do most of our work on rectangles instead of arbitrary shapes. <a href="https://planetmath.org/proofofgoursatstheorem">Here</a> is a proof of it.</p>
            </details>
            <details class="theorem">
                <summary>Cauchy integral formula</summary>
                <p>This is different from the integral theorem. This one says that if \(f\) is a holomorphic function deifned on some region \(\Omega\), if \(a\in\Omega\), and if \(r>0\) is small enough that \(\overline{B_r(a)}\subset\Omega\) then for every \(w\) with \(|w-a|\lt r\), \[f(w)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\partial\overline{B_r(a)}}\frac{f(z)}{z-w}dz\]</p>
                <p>The proof relies on Cauchy's integral theorem. By that theorem, we can change the path of integration to be as small of a circle around \(w\) as we want without changing the value. As we get arbitrarily close to \(w\), \(f(z)\sim f(w)\) because \(f\) is continuous. Then we simply calculate \[\int_\gamma\frac{f(w)}{z-w}dz=2\pi if(w)\] to get what we want. The only technicalities are in the approximation \(f(z)\sim f(w)\). Recall the most important calculation of complex analysis, \(\int_{|z|=1}\frac{1}{z}dz=2\pi i\).</p>
                <p>We can extend this, using the geometric series expansion of \(\frac{1}{z-w}\), to prove that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analyticity_of_holomorphic_functions">holomorphic functions are analytic</a>. With that we can get Cauchy's extended integral formula,\[f^{(n)}(w)=\frac{n!}{2\pi i}\int_{\partial\overline{B_r(a)}}\frac{f(z)}{(z-w)^{n+1}}dz\]</p>

                <summary>Morera's theorem</summary>
                <p>Let \(\Omega\) be a region in \(\mathbb{C}\) and suppose \(f:\Omega\to\mathbb{C}\) satisfies that, for all closed curves \(\gamma\) in \(\Omega\),\[\int_\gamma f(z)dz=0\]</p>
                <p>Then \(f\) is holomorphic.</p>
                <p>Proof: define an antiderivative for \(f\) inspired by the fundamental theorem of calculus. Fix a point \(z_0\in\Omega\) and for any \(w\in\Omega\) define \(F(w)=\int_{p_w}f(z)dz\) where \(p_w\) is a path starting at \(z_0\) and ending at \(w\). The definition of \(F\) is independent of path because of the closed curve assumption. Then show that \(F\) is an antiderivative of \(f\). Do this directly with difference quotient, using the fact that \(f\) is continuous.</p>
                \[\lim_{w\to z_0}\frac{F(w)-F(z_0)}{w-z_0}=\lim_{w\to z_0}\frac{1}{w-z_0}\int_{p_w}f(z)dz\]
                <p>If \(w\) is near enough to \(z_0\), then \(p_w\) can be taken to be the straight line \(tw+(1-t)z_0\) for \(0\leq t\leq1\).</p>
                \[=\lim_{w\to z_0}\frac{1}{w-z_0}\int_0^1f(tw+(1-t)z_0)(w-z_0)dt=\lim_{w\to z_0}\int_0^1f(tw+(1-t)z_0)dt\]
                <p>If \(w\) is close to \(z_0\), then \(f(tw+(1-t)z_0)\) will be close to \(f(z_0)\).</p>
                \[\sim\lim_{w\to z_0}\int_0^1f(z_0)dt=f(z_0)\]
                <p>Thus the difference quotient of \(F\) gives that \(F'=f\). That, in particular, shows that \(F\) is holomorphic. Derivatives of holomorphic functions are holomorphic, so \(f\) is also holomorphic.</p>
                <p>This theorem is proven by constructing a global antiderivative. We never used the fact that the antiderivative is global, however, so we can do the same construction to obtain a local antiderivative under the weaker assumption that we only force \(\int_\gamma f(z)dz=0\) for closed curves \(\gamma\) which only encircle points in \(\Omega\), which is weaker because there are fewer of these than there are of all closed paths. This applies to non-simply-connected domains, as well. The only difference is that the antiderivative \(F\) will only be locally defined.</p>

Good cues are that the outer bounds above guide our first steps, and the Poisson kernel will be what is left in the middle. We don&apos;t have to memorize the kernel for this problem, we actually end up creating it.

                Square the inequalities. This preserves the inequalities because each term is positive, because \(r&lt;R\).
                \[(R-r)^2\leq|Re^{it}-re^{i\theta}|^2\leq(R+r)^2\]

                Flip them.
                \[\frac{1}{(R-r)^2}\geq\frac{1}{|Re^{it}-re^{i\theta}|^2}\geq\frac{1}{(R+r)^2}\]
                \[\frac{1}{(R+r)^2}\leq\frac{1}{|Re^{it}-re^{i\theta}|^2}\leq\frac{1}{(R-r)^2}\]

                Multiply all by \(R^2-r^2\), which is positive because \(r&lt;R\).
                \[\frac{R-r}{R+r}\leq\frac{R^2-r^2}{|Re^{it}-re^{i\theta}|^2}\leq\frac{R+r}{R-r}\]

                Integrate all terms the same way, the way which makes the outer bounds become the mean value property. This step uses the fact that \(u\geq0\) to preserve the inequality.
                \[\int_{-\pi}^\pi\frac{R-r}{R+r}u(a+Re^{it})dt\leq\int_{-\pi}^\pi\frac{R^2-r^2}{|Re^{it}-re^{i\theta}|^2}u(a+Re^{it})dt\leq\int_{-\pi}^\pi\frac{R+r}{R-r}u(a+Re^{it})dt\]

                Voil&#224;, the outer terms are the mean value property and the inner term is the Poisson kernel. We use harmonicity of \(u\) for the mean value properties on the outsides and the Poisson kernel/Dirichlet solution on the inside.
                \[\frac{R-r}{R+r}u(a)\leq u(a+re^{i\theta})\leq\frac{R+r}{R-r}u(a)\]

                <summary>Argument principle</summary>
                <p>Statement: Let \(\Omega\) be a region and suppose \(f\) is a meromorphic function on \(\Omega\). Let \(\gamma\) be a positively oriented simple closed curve which does not pass through any zeroes or poles of \(f\). Then \[\int_\gamma\frac{f&apos;(z)}{f(z)}dz=(2\pi i)(Z-P)\] where \(Z,P\) are the numbers of zeroes and poles of \(f\), respectively, which lie in the region bounded by \(\gamma\).</p>
                <p>Note that by the chain rule (u-substitution),\[\int_\gamma\frac{f&apos;(z)}{f(z)}dz=\int_{f\circ\gamma}\frac{1}{z}dz\]is simply the winding number of the image of \(\gamma\) around the origin.</p>
                <p>Proof: Factor the zeroes and poles of \(f\) to get \[f(z)=g(z)\prod_{i=1}^n(z-z_i)\prod_{j=1}^m\frac{1}{z-p_j}\] Here \(z_1,\ldots,z_n\) are the zeroes of \(f\) and \(p_1,\ldots,p_m\) are the poles. Note that \(g\) has no roots or poles inside \(\gamma\). Compute the logarithmic derivative of \(f\), not \(f&apos;\) directly: \[\frac{f&apos;(z_0)}{f(z_0)}=\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\ln(f(z))|_{z=z_0}\] \[\ln(f(z))=\ln(g(z))+\sum_{i=1}^n\ln(z-z_i)-\sum_{j-1}^m\ln(z-p_j)\] Then take the integral \[\int_\gamma(\ln(f(z))&apos;dz=\int_\gamma(\ln(g(z))&apos;dz+\sum_{i=1}^n\int_\gamma(\ln(z-z_i))&apos;dz-\sum_{j-1}^m\int_\gamma(\ln(z-p_j))&apos;dz\] \[=\int_\gamma\frac{g&apos;(z)}{g(z)}dz+\sum_{i=1}^n\int_\gamma\frac{1}{z-z_i}dz-\sum_{j=1}^m\frac{1}{z-p_j}dz\] Recall \(g\) has no poles or roots inside \(\gamma\), so \(\frac{g&apos;}{g}\) is a holomorphic function inside \(\gamma\). Thus by Cauchy&apos;s integral theorem \(\int_\gamma\frac{g&apos;(z)}{g(z)}dz=0\). The rest of the terms pick up a copy of \(2\pi i\) for each term because \(\int_{|z|=1}\frac{1}{z}dz=2\pi i\). Thus \[\int_\gamma\frac{f&apos;(z)}{f(z)}dz=0+\sum_{i=1}^n(2\pi i)-\sum_{j=1}^m(2\pi i)=2\pi i(n-m)\] which is the statement.</p>
                <p>Note that you can replace \(f(z)\) by \(f(z)-a\) to count poles and preimages of \(a\), just use the argument principle on \(g(z)=f(z)-a\).</p>

                <p>Let \(\Omega\) be a region and \(\gamma\) a simple closed curve in \(\Omega\). Suppose \(f,g:\Omega\to\mathbb{C}\) are holomorphic and suppose they do not vanish on \(\gamma\). Assume that for all points \(z\) on \(\gamma\), \[|f(z)|&lt;|g(z)|\] Then \(g\) and \(f+g\) have the same number of zeroes inside \(\gamma\).</p>
                <p>Proof: The number of zeroes \(Z\) of \(g\) is given by the argument principle, \[\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{g\circ\gamma}\frac{1}{z}dz\] That is, the number of zeroes of \(g\) inside \(\gamma\) is the number of times the image of \(\gamma\) under \(g\) winds around \(0\). We are going to show that this number is the same for \(g\) as it is for \(f+g\).</p>
                <p>By our assumption, \(|f(z)|&lt;|g(z)|\) for all \(z\in\gamma\). Take the straight line \(tg(z)+(1-t)(f(z)+g(z))\) connecting \(g(z)\) to \(f(z)+g(z)\) for \(0\leq t\leq1\). We will show this line does not pass through 0. For simpler notations, let \(a=f(z)\) and \(b=g(z)\). Then \(|a|&lt;|b|\) and we are claiming that \(tb+(1-t)(a+b)\neq0\) for all \(0\leq t\leq 1\). By assumption, \(g(z)\neq0\) because \(|g(z)|\) must be in particular strictly positive. Thus our claim holds for \(t=1\). If \(t\neq1\) (so that \(1-t&gt;0\)), \[|tb+(1-t)(a+b)|=|(1-t)a+b|=|b-(1-t)(-a)|\] \[\geq|b|-(1-t)|-a|=|b|-(1-t)|a|&gt;|b|-(1-t)|b|=t|b|\geq0\] The second-to-last inequality is strict (by assumption and the fact that \(1-t&gt;0\)), so overall this is a strict inequality, meaning the term we are interested in cannot be 0 because its norm is strictly positive.</p>
                <p>Now that we have shown the straight line from \(g(z)\) to \(f(z)+g(z)\) does not pass through \(0\) for any \(z\in\gamma\), we consider the pointwise straight-line-homotopy between the curves \(g\circ\gamma\) and \((f+g)\circ\gamma\). We have shown this homotopy never hits \(0\), so it is a path homotopy in \(\mathbb{C}\setminus\{0\}\) which is the domain on which \(\frac{1}{z}\) is holomorphic. Thus by Cauchy&apos;s integral theorem (path homotopy version), the integrals below are the same. \[\int_{g\circ\gamma}\frac{1}{z}dz=\int_{(f+g)\circ\gamma}\frac{1}{z}dz\] Then by the argument principle, the number of zeroes of \(g\) and \(f+g\) are the same.</p>

                <p>Proof: Choose \(r&gt;0\) small enough that \(f(z)\neq f(a)\) for any \(0&lt;|z-a|\leq r\). This is possible by the uniqueness principle, the roots of a nonconstant holomorphic function are isolated. Take the function \(\frac{f&apos;(z)}{f(z)-f(a)}\). This is holomorphic on a thin annulus containing the circle \(c=\{z:|z-a|=r\}\). On this annulus, \(\frac{f_n&apos;(z)}{f_n(z)-f(a)}\to\frac{f&apos;(z)}{f(z)-f(a)}\) uniformly.

                <p>Proof: Consider the function \(g(z)=\frac{f(z)}{z}\). By assumption, \(0\) is a root of \(f\) which means \(g\) is holomorphic. The maximum modulus principle means that the maximum of \(g\) occurs on its boundary. On the boundary \(|z|=1\),\[|g(z)|=\left|\frac{f(z)}{z}\right|=|f(z)|\leq1\]Thus for all \(z\in\overline D\)\[|g(z)|\leq1\]If \(z\neq0\) then multiplying by \(|z|\) gives \[|f(z)|\leq|z|\]At \(z=0\), \(g(0)=f&apos;(0)\) by definition of the difference quotient.

                <p>Let \(\Omega\) be a simply connected region in \(\mathbb{C}\) which is not the whole plane. Then \(\Omega\) is biholomorphic to the unit disc \(D\). Moreover, if \(a\in\Omega\) there is a unique biholomorphism \(f:\Omega\to D\) such that \(f(a)=0\) and \(f'(a)>0\)</p>
                <p>Proof: Uniqueness comes from the Schwarz lemma. Suppose \(f,g\) are both biholomorphisms from \(\Omega\) to the disc with \(f(a)=g(a)=0\) and \(f'(a)>0, g'(a)>0\). Then \(H=f\circ g^{-1}\) and \(H^{-1}=g\circ f^{-1}\) are automorphisms of the disc which fix 0, so by the Scharz lemma \[|H(z)|\leq|z|=|H^{-1}(H(z))|\leq|H(z)|\]</p>
                <p>Therefore the inequalities are equalities and by Schwarz lemma \(H=\lambda\cdot\text{id}\), or \((f\circ g^{-1})(z)=\lambda z\), where \(|\lambda|=1\). Taking the derivative of both sides at \(z=0\) gives\[\frac{f'(a)}{g'(a)}=\lambda\]Because both \(f'(a)\) and \(g'(a)\) are positive real numbers, \(\lambda\) must be a positive real number as well. Also we know \(|\lambda|=1\), so \(\lambda=1\) making \(f\circ g^{-1}=\text{id}\). That shows \(f=g\).</p>
                <p>Now to show that the Riemann map exists. We first need to show there exists a nonconstant bounded holomorphic function \(f\) on \(\Omega\). From there we can do some analysis to construct the biholomorphism. We are going to perform a series of injective holomorphic transformations to our region \(\Omega\). First, we assumed that \(\Omega\) is not the whole plane so let \(z_0\notin\mathbb{C}\). Then define \(\Omega_1\) to be the image of \(\Omega\) under the map \(z-z_0\). Then \(\Omega_1\) is a simply connected region which does not contain 0 and is biholomorphic to \(\Omega\).</p>
                <p>Now we are going to define a branch of log on \(\Omega_1\). Fix a point \(l\in\Omega_1\) and for any \(z\in\Omega_1\) let \(p_z\) be a path in \(\Omega_1\) starting at \(l\) and ending at \(z\). Define \[\ln(z)=\int_{p_z}\frac{1}{z}dz\]First we need to check this is well-defined. Suppose \(p_z,p'_z\) are two paths from \(l\) to \(z\). Then \(p_z-p'_z\) is a loop in \(\Omega_1\). Because \(\Omega_1\) is simply connected, this loop is contractible. Then by Cauchy's integral theorem (homotopy version),\[\int_{p_z}\frac{1}{z}dz-\int_{p'_z}\frac{1}{z}dz=\int_{p_z-p'_z}\frac{1}{z}dz=\int_l\frac{1}{z}dz=0\]Thus our function \(\ln\) is well-defined. As to why it is a branch of log, by construction \(\ln'(z)=\frac{1}{z}\) and \(\ln(l)=0\). For fun we will now show that any antiderivative of \(\frac{1}{z}\) with a certain initial condition satisfied by our \(\ln\) must be a branch of log.</p>
                <p>Suppose \(f\) is a function defined on a region in \(\mathbb{C}^*\) with \(f'(z)=\frac{1}{z}\) and suppose there is some \(a\) in our region and some integer \(k\) for which \(f(a)=2k\pi i\). Then\[\left(e^f\right)'(z)=\frac{e^{f(z)}}{z}\]Thus \(e^f\) is a solution to the differential equation \(f'(z)=\frac{1}{z}f(z)\). The solution space to this equation is one dimensional (first order equation) and is spanned by the identity function, so \(e^f=\lambda\text{id}\). To solve for \(\lambda\), plug in \(a\) to get \(\lambda a=e^{f(a)}=e^{2k\pi i}=1\). Thus \(e^f=\text{id}\), so \(f\) is a branch of log.</p>
                <p>Now we have constructed a branch of log on \(\Omega_1\). Note that branches of log are injective because by definition a branch of log is a section of the exponential map and sections must be injective (section means right inverse). Define the map \(\sqrt z\) on \(\Omega_1\) by \(\sqrt{z}=e^{\frac{1}{2}\ln(z)}\). Note \(\left(e^{\frac{1}{2}\ln(z)}\right)^2=e^{\ln(z)}=z\). The property we are interested in for \(\sqrt z\) is called \(\pm\) injectivity. Suppose that \(a,b\) are in \(\Omega_1\) and \(\sqrt a=\pm\sqrt b\). Squaring both sides gives that \(a=b\). Note that \(\pm\) injectivity implies, in particular, injectivity. Define \(\Omega_2\) to be the image of \(\Omega_1\) under \(\sqrt z\).</p>
                <p>Now we have a region \(\Omega_2\) which is biholomorphic to \(\Omega\). Moreover, being the image of a region under the exponential map, \(0\notin\Omega_2\). We will show \(\Omega_2\) is actually missing an entire neighborhood of \(\mathbb{C}\). Choose any point \(c\in\Omega_2\) and any ball \(B\) centered at \(c\) with \(B\subset\Omega_2\). Such a ball exists because \(\Omega\) was open and biholomorphisms are open maps, so \(\Omega_2\) is open. Define \(-B=\{z|-z\in B\}\). We will show \(-B\cap\Omega_2=\emptyset\). Suppose \(w\in-B\). Then \(-w\in B\subset\Omega_2\), so \(-w=\sqrt z\) for some \(z\in\Omega_1\), or \(w=-\sqrt{z}\). If there were some \(z'\in\Omega_1\) with \(w=\sqrt{z'}\) then \(\sqrt{z'}=-\sqrt z\), which by \(\pm\) injectivity means \(z=z'\), meaning \(w=-w=0\). However, \(0\notin\Omega_2\). Thus \(-B\cap\Omega_2=\emptyset\).</p>
                <p>Define \(\Omega_3\) to be the image of \(\Omega_2\) under the biholomorphism \(z-(-c)=z+c\). This biholomorphism puts the center of \(-B\) at the origin. Let \(r\) be the radius of \(B\). Then for all \(z\in\Omega_3, |z|&gt;r\).</p>
                <p>Define \(\Omega_4\) to be the image of \(\Omega_3\) under the injective holomorphism \(\frac{1}{z}\). Then for all \(z\in\Omega_4, z=\frac{1}{y}\) for some \(y\in\Omega_3\). Being in \(\Omega_3, |y|&gt;r\). Thus \(|z|&lt;\frac{1}{r}\). That is, \(\Omega_4\) is a bounded domain which is biholomorphic to \(\Omega\).</p>
                <p>From here we can use translations, rotations, and scaling to obtain an injective holomorphism from \(\Omega\) into the unit disc which sends \(a\) to \(0\) with positive derivative. If we consider the set of all such functions, we can do a supremum argument on the value of the derivative at \(a\) to obtain a sequence of functions. We can show this sequence converges to the Riemann map we are looking for. This part of the proof is never on the qual so we won't go into it here.</p>

                <p>First, let&apos;s recall the Arzela Ascoli theorem (AA). That is that \(\mathcal{F}\) is normal if and only if two properties: 1) for each \(z_0\in\Omega\), the set \(\{f(z_0)|f\in\mathcal{F}\}\) has compact closure in \(\Omega\), 2) \(\mathcal{F}\) is equicontinuous at every point \(z_0\in\Omega\).</p>
                <p>Equicontinuous at \(z_0\) means that for all \(\epsilon&gt;0\) there is a \(\delta&gt;0\) such that for all \(f\in\mathcal{F}\) and for all \(z\in\Omega\) with \(|z-z_0|&lt;\delta\), \(|f(z)-f(z_0)|&lt;\epsilon\).</p>
                <p>To be locally bounded at \(z_0\in\Omega\), there have to be constants \(M,r&gt;0\) such that for all \(z\in\Omega\) with \(|z-z_0|&lt;r\), for all \(f\in\mathcal{F}\), then \(|f(z)|&lt;M\).</p>
                <p>Now to work on the theorem. Suppose \(\mathcal{F}\) is normal and let \(z_0\) be an element of \(\Omega\). Then the result of Arzela-Ascoli theorem holds. Let \(M\) be such that \(|f(z_0)|\leq M\) for all \(f\), this is result 1) of AA. By result 2), there is a \(\delta&gt;0\) such that \(|f(z)-f(z_0)|&lt;M+\epsilon\) for all \(f\in\mathcal{F}\) and for all \(z\in B_{\delta}(z_0)\). This shows that \(\mathcal{F}\) is locally bounded at \(z_0\), with the constants \(M+\epsilon\) and \(\delta\).</p>
                <p>Now suppose that \(\mathcal{F}\) is locally bounded at all points in \(\Omega\). This assumption immediately shows part 1) of AA, because bounded subsets of \(\mathbb{C}\) are relatively compact. We need to show \(\mathcal{F}\) is equicontinuous at \(z_0\). Take the constants \(M,r\) from the definition of locally bounded, also choose \(r\) small enough so that \(\overline{B_r(z_0)}\subset\Omega\). Then for all \(z\in B_r(z_0)\) and all \(f\in\mathcal{F}\), we have asusmed that \(|f(z)|\leq M\).</p>
                <p>Let \(\epsilon&gt;0\) be given. Let \(z\in\Omega\) with \(|z-z_0|&lt;\frac{r}{2}\). Let \(\gamma\) be the circle \(|z-z_0|=r\). By Cauchy&apos;s integral formula applied to arbitrary \(f\in\mathcal{F}\), \[|f(z)-f(z_0)|=\left|\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_\gamma\frac{f(w)}{w-z}dw-\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_\gamma\frac{f(w)}{w-z_0}dw\right|=\frac{1}{2\pi}\left|\int_\gamma\frac{f(w)(z-z_0)}{(w-z)(w-z_0)}dw\right|\] \[\leq\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_\gamma\left|\frac{f(w)(z-z_0)}{(w-z)(w-z_0)}\right||dw|\] Here we will use some bounds. \(|f(w)|\leq M\), \(|w-z_0|=r\), and \(|w-z|\geq\frac{r}{2}\). Thus \[\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_\gamma\left|f(w)(z-z_0)\frac{1}{w-z}\frac{1}{w-z_0}\right||dw|\leq\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_\gamma M|z-z_0|\frac{2}{r}\frac{1}{r}|dw|=\frac{M}{\pi r^2}|z-z_0|\int_\gamma|dw|=\frac{2M}{r}|z-z_0|&lt;\frac{3M}{r}|z-z_0|\] Therefore if we choose \(\delta\) to be \(0&lt;\delta&lt;\frac{r\epsilon}{2}\) (so this whole argument applies) and less than \(\frac{r}{3M}\), then we have shown equicontinuous and therefore (by AA) normal.</p>

Given any point \(p\in M\), let the integer \(f_p\) be defined as \[f_p=\begin{cases}0&amp;f(p)\neq0\text{ and }f(p)\neq\infty\\d&amp;p\text{ is a zero of }f\text{ of order }d\\-d&amp;p\text{ is a pole of }f\text{ of order }d\end{cases}\] Then the expression \[\|f\|=\sum_{p\in M}f_p\] is well-defined because there are only finitely many \(p\) where \(f_p\neq0\), this is a consequence of the uniqueness theorem (so zeroes and poles are isolated) and the fact that \(M\) is compact.</p>
                <p>Consider the free abelian group \(\langle M\rangle\) generated by the set \(M\), alternately this is the free \(\mathbb{Z}\) module generated by points in \(M\). Elements of \(\langle M\rangle\) are called divisors. The divisor \((f)\in\langle M\rangle\) associated to \(f\) is defined to be \[(f)=\sum_{p\in M}f_pp\] Given any divisor \(D\), \(D\) takes the form \[D=\sum_{p\in M}d_pp\] where \(d_p\in\mathbb{Z}\) and all but finitely many \(d_p\) are \(0\). We define \[\|D\|=\sum_{p\in M}d_p\] Given two divisors \(D,D&apos;\), we say \(D\leq D&apos;\) if \(d_p\leq d&apos;_p\) for all \(p\in M\). Given two meromorphic functions \(f,g\) on \(M\), we have that \((f)\leq(g)\) if every zero of \(f\) is also a zero of \(g\) of at least as high a degree, and every pole of \(g\) is also a pole of \(f\) of at least as high a degree. Also, \(-(f)=\left(\frac{1}{f}\right)\) because negating the divisor corresponds to swapping zeroes and poles, which is what inverting the function does as well.</p>
                <p>Given a divisor \(D\geq0\), we want to define the quantity \(l(D)\). First, consider the set \(L(D)\) where elements of \(L(D)\) are meromorphic functions \(f\) on \(M\) such that \(-(f)\leq D\). This condition is a bound on how bad the poles at \(f\) can be. Then \(L(D)\) is a vector space over \(\mathbb{C}\), because adding meromorphic functions and scaling cannot move poles and cannot introduce more poles. Then we define \(l(D)\) to be the dimension of \(L(D)\). We also want to mention that \(l(K-D)\) represents the dimension of the vector space of holomorphic one-forms which must vanish at any point \(p\) where \(d_p&gt;0\), though we don&apos;t care so much about the details of this part.</p>
                <p>We are finally ready to state the Riemann Roch theorem. Suppose \(D\) is a divisor on \(M\) where \(M\) has genus \(g\). Then \[l(D)-l(K-D)=\|D\|-g+1\] In particular, \(l(K-D)\geq0\) so \[l(D)\geq\|D\|-g+1\]</p>
                <p>We don't prove this.</p>
                <p>Note that I have been using \(\|D\|\) to mean what is commonly referred to as degree of \(D\), or \(deg(D)\). I was hoping to avoid confusion with degree of a function.</p>
