<problem><p>Let \(u\) be a positive harmonic function over the punctured plane \(\mathbb{C}\setminus\{0\}\). Show that \(u\) must be constant.</p></problem><solution><p>Look at the composition map \(U:\mathbb{C}\to[0,\infty)\),</p><p>\[\mathbb{C}\xrightarrow{\exp}\mathbb{C}\setminus\{0\}\xrightarrow{u}[0,\infty)\]</p><p>Precomposing a harmonic function with a holomorphic function gives a harmonic function. This can be computed directly using the Cauchy-Riemann equations, https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/151827/composition-of-a-harmonic-function-with-a-holomorphic-function-is-still-harmonic </p><p> Now we answer a simpler question: show any nonnegative harmonic function \(U\) defined on all of \(\mathbb{C}\) must be constant. Recall Harnack&apos;s inequality, it is stated below for a ball of radius \(R\) centered at the origin and a point \(re^{i\theta}\) in the ball. </p><p>\[\frac{R-r}{R+r}U(0)\leq U(re^{i\theta})\leq\frac{R+r}{R-r}U(0)\]</p><p> Letting \(R\to\infty\) gives that \(U(0)=U(re^{i\theta})\), so \(U\) is constant. In this problem, \(U=u\circ\exp\) and \(\exp\) is surjective, so \(U\) being constant forces \(u\) to be constant.</p></solution><topics><Harmonic/><FunctionBounds/><ExpAndTrig/><Harnack/><EntireFunction/></topics><instructors><a/><b/></instructors>
