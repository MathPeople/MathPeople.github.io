<problem><p>Let \(G\) be a region and suppose that \(f_n\) is analytic in \(G\) for each \(n\in\mathbb{N}\). Suppose that \((f_n)\) converges uniformly to a function \(f\) on \(G\). Show that \(f\) is analytic.</p></problem><solution><p>There are many ways to do this one; we choose Morera&apos;s theorem. Let \(a\in G\) and let \(\gamma\) be a contractible-in-\(G\) loop with winding number \(1\) about \(a\). Then by Cauchy&apos;s integral theorem</p><p>\[\int_\gamma f_n(z)dz=0\]</p><p>for all \(n\). Because \(f_n\to f\) uniformly,</p><p>\[\int_\gamma f(z)dz=\lim\int_\gamma f_n(z)dz=0\]</p><p>Therefore \(f\) is analytic by Morera&apos;s theroem.</p></solution><topics><CauchyIntegralFormula/><SequenceOfFunctions/><SumConvergence/><CauchyIntegralTheorem/><Morera/></topics>
