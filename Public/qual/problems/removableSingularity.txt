<problem><p>Let \(f:\mathbb{D}^*\to\mathbb{D}\) be holomorphic. Prove (without using the classification of removable singularities) that \(f\) extends to a holomorphic function from \(\mathbb{D}\to\mathbb{D}\).</p></problem><solution><p>Because \(f\) is bounded, the function \(g\) defined as \(g(z)=z^2f(z)\) is continuous at the origin, vanishing at \(0\). Taking the difference quotient gives</p><p>\[\lim_{h\to0}\frac{h^2f(h)}{h}=0\]</p><p>That is, by definition \(g&apos;(0)=0\). Therefore \(g\) is holomorphic on the whole disc. Then the local mapping theorem, coordinate-free version states that \(f\) is holomorphic on the disc because of how \(g\) is represented and because \(g\) and \(g&apos;\) vanish at the origin.</p></solution><topics><FunctionBounds/><ClassificationOfSingularities/><Degree/><HolomorphicMeansAnalytic/></topics><instructors><e/></instructors>
