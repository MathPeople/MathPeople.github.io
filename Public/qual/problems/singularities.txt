<problem><p>Let \(f\) be an entire function and let \(g:\mathbb{C}^*\to\mathbb{C}\) be given by</p><p>\[g(z)=f\left(\frac{1}{z}\right)\]</p><p>Then \(0\) is an isolated singularity of \(g\). Prove the following classification of this singularity:</p><p>removable \(\iff\) \(f\) is constant</p><p>pole \(\iff\) \(f\) is a nonconstant polynomial</p><p>essential \(\iff\) \(f\) is not constant and there is a \(w\in\mathbb{C}\) for which \(f^{-1}(w)\) is an infinite set</p><p>Use this to prove what I think should be called the fundamental theorem of algebra because it is more fundamental: Any nonconstant polynomial over \(\mathbb{C}\) has at most finitely many roots (to be clear, I think this statement with &quot;\(\mathbb{C}\)&quot; replaced by &quot;any field&quot; is what should be called the FTA).</p></problem><solution><p>If 0 is a removable singularity of \(g\) then \(\lim_{z\to\infty}f(z)=g(0)\). We claim this makes \(f\) bounded. Let \(R&gt;0\) such that</p><p>\[|z|&gt;R\implies|f(z)-g(0)|&lt;1\]</p><p>Then for all \(|z|&gt;R\) we have \(|f(z)|&lt;|g(0)|+1\), so \(f\) is bounded for \(|z|&gt;R\). The set \(\overline{B_R(0)}\) is compact and \(f\) is continuous, so \(f\) is bounded there too. Thus \(f\) is bounded and therefore constant by Liouville&apos;s theorem. For the reverse direction, if \(f\) is constant then \(g\) is constant so the singularity is trivially removable.</p><p>Now suppose the singularity of \(g\) is a pole. Then \(\lim_{z\to\infty}f(z)=\infty\). That is, \(f\) extends to a holomorphic function from the Riemann sphere to itself. We know the only holomorphic functions from the Riemann sphere to itself are rational functions, and \(f\) has no poles in \(\mathbb{C}\), so \(f\) must be a polynomial. The reverse direction, as in the previous case, is trivial.</p><p>Finally for the essential singularity case. By the Casorati-Weierstrass theorem, the image of any (punctured) neighborhood of \(0\) under \(g\) is dense because \(g\) has an essential singularity there. The image of \(g\) can differ from the image of \(f\) by at most the single point \(f(0)\), so the image of \(B_R(z)^c\) under \(f\) is also dense in \(\mathbb{C}\). For each \(n\), let</p><p>\[U_n=f\left(\overline{B_n(0)}^c\right)\]</p><p>Then each \(U_n\) is an open dense set. By the Baire category theorem,</p><p>\[W=\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty U_n\]</p><p>is dense and, in particular, nonempty. Let \(w\in W\). Then for every \(n\) there is a point \(y_n\in\mathbb{C}\) with \(|y_n|&gt;n\) such that \(f(y_n)=w\). There must be infinitely many distinct \(y_n\) because no complex number has infinite modulus. This proves the forward direction. For the reverse direction, suppose there is such a \(w\). The roots of \(f-w\) must grow arbitrarily large as per the uniqueness principle because \(f\) is not constant. Then the roots of \(g-w\) must grow arbitrarily small. If the singularity at \(0\) were removable, the uniqueness principle would show \(g\), and hence \(f\), to be constant, which is not the case. The singularity is certainly not a pole because \(g\) vanishes arbitrarily close to 0, it cannot approach \(\infty\) near 0. Thus the singularity is essential.</p><p>For the &quot;FTA,&quot; suppose \(f\) is a nonconstant polynomial. Then the singularity of \(g\) is a pole and hence not essential. We know \(f\) to be nonconstant, so it must be that the preimage of any point (0 in particular) under \(f\) is finite.</p></solution><topics><FunctionBounds/><PointSetTopology/><OpenMappingTheorem/><ClassificationOfSingularities/><EntireFunction/><FundamentalTheoremOfAlgebra/><UniquenessPrinciple/><Liouville/></topics><instructors><e/></instructors>
