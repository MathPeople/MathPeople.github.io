<problem><p>State and prove Montel&apos;s theorem.</p></problem><solution><p>Statement: Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be a family of holomorphic functions defined on a region \(\Omega\). Then \(\mathcal{F}\) is normal if and only if \(\mathcal{F}\) is locally bounded.</p><p>First, let&apos;s recall the Arzela Ascoli theorem (AA). That is that \(\mathcal{F}\) is normal if and only if two properties: 1) for each \(z_0\in\Omega\), the set \(\{f(z_0)|f\in\mathcal{F}\}\) has compact closure in \(\Omega\), 2) \(\mathcal{F}\) is equicontinuous at every point \(z_0\in\Omega\). </p><p>\[\]</p><p> Equicontinuous at \(z_0\) means that for all \(\epsilon&gt;0\) there is a \(\delta&gt;0\) such that for all \(f\in\mathcal{F}\) and for all \(z\in\Omega\) with \(|z-z_0|&lt;\delta\), \(|f(z)-f(z_0)|&lt;\epsilon\). </p><p>\[\]</p><p> To be locally bounded at \(z_0\in\Omega\), there have to be constants \(M,r&gt;0\) such that for all \(z\in\Omega\) with \(|z-z_0|&lt;r\), for all \(f\in\mathcal{F}\), then \(|f(z)|&lt;M\). </p><p>\[\]</p><p> Now to work on the theorem. Suppose \(\mathcal{F}\) is normal and let \(z_0\) be an element of \(\Omega\). Then the result of Arzela-Ascoli theorem holds. Let \(M\) be such that \(|f(z_0)|\leq M\) for all \(f\), this is result 1) of AA. By result 2), there is a \(\delta&gt;0\) such that \(|f(z)-f(z_0)|&lt;M+\epsilon\) for all \(f\in\mathcal{F}\) and for all \(z\in B_{\delta}(z_0)\). This shows that \(\mathcal{F}\) is locally bounded at \(z_0\), with the constants \(M+\epsilon\) and \(\delta\). </p><p>\[\]</p><p> Now suppose that \(\mathcal{F}\) is locally bounded at all points in \(\Omega\). This assumption immediately shows part 1) of AA, because bounded subsets of \(\mathbb{C}\) are relatively compact. We need to show \(\mathcal{F}\) is equicontinuous at \(z_0\). Take the constants \(M,r\) from the definition of locally bounded, also choose \(r\) small enough so that \(\overline{B_r(z_0)}\subset\Omega\). Then for all \(z\in B_r(z_0)\) and all \(f\in\mathcal{F}\), we have asusmed that \(|f(z)|\leq M\). </p><p>\[\]</p><p> Let \(\epsilon&gt;0\) be given. Let \(z\in\Omega\) with \(|z-z_0|&lt;\frac{r}{2}\). Let \(\gamma\) be the circle \(|z-z_0|=r\). By Cauchy&apos;s integral formula applied to arbitrary \(f\in\mathcal{F}\), </p><p>\[|f(z)-f(z_0)|=\left|\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_\gamma\frac{f(w)}{w-z}dw-\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_\gamma\frac{f(w)}{w-z_0}dw\right|=\frac{1}{2\pi}\left|\int_\gamma\frac{f(w)(z-z_0)}{(w-z)(w-z_0)}dw\right|\]</p><p> </p><p>\[\leq\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_\gamma\left|\frac{f(w)(z-z_0)}{(w-z)(w-z_0)}\right||dw|\]</p><p> Here we will use some bounds. \(|f(w)|\leq M\), \(|w-z_0|=r\), and \(|w-z|\geq\frac{r}{2}\). Thus </p><p>\[\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_\gamma\left|f(w)(z-z_0)\frac{1}{w-z}\frac{1}{w-z_0}\right||dw|\leq\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_\gamma M|z-z_0|\frac{2}{r}\frac{1}{r}|dw|=\frac{M}{\pi r^2}|z-z_0|\int_\gamma|dw|=\frac{2M}{r}|z-z_0|&lt;\frac{3M}{r}|z-z_0|\]</p><p> Therefore if we choose \(\delta\) to be \(0&lt;\delta&lt;\frac{r\epsilon}{2}\) (so this whole argument applies) and less than \(\frac{r}{3M}\), then we have shown equicontinuous and therefore (by AA) normal.</p></solution><topics><IntegralEstimates/><FunctionBounds/><CauchyIntegralFormula/><Montel/></topics><instructors><a/><c/></instructors>
