<problem><p>Let \(f\) be an entire function and suppose there is a constant \(M\), an \(R&gt;0\), and a natural number \(n\) such that \(|f(z)|\leq M|z|^n\) for all \(|z|&gt;R\). Show \(f\) is a polynomial of degree no more than \(n\).</p></problem><solution><p>Write \(f\) as its Maclauren series,</p><p>\[f(z)=\sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{f^{(k)}(0)}{k!}z^k\]</p><p>We will estimate the terms \(\frac{f^{(k)}(0)}{k!}\) using Cauchy&apos;s integral formula. That formula is that </p><p>\[\frac{f^{(k)}(0)}{k!}=2\pi i\int_\gamma\frac{f(z)}{z^{k+1}}dz\]</p><p> where \(\gamma\) is the circle of radius \(R&gt;0\). Then we can perform the estimate </p><p>\[\left|\frac{f^{(k)}(0)}{k!}\right|=2\pi\left|\int_\gamma\frac{f(z)}{z^{k+1}}dz\right|\leq2\pi\int_\gamma\frac{|f(z)|}{R^{k+1}}|dz|\]</p><p> </p><p>\[\leq2\pi\int_\gamma\frac{MR^n}{R^{k+1}}|dz|=\frac{4M\pi^2}{R^{k-n}}\]</p><p> For any \(k&gt;n\), this will go to \(0\) as \(R\to\infty\) (this is where we use that \(f\) is entire). That means all coefficients in the power series above \(n\) vanish, so \(f\) is a polynomial of degree no more than \(n\).</p></solution><topics><CauchyIntegralFormula/><IntegralEstimates/><FunctionBounds/><EntireFunction/><CauchyEstimate/></topics><instructors><c/></instructors>
