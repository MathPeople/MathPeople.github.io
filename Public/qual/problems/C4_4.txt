<problem><p>Prove that there exists no non-constant holomorphic map from \(\mathbb{C}\) to \(\Sigma_g\) for \(g\geq2\).</p></problem><solution><p>First recall that the universal cover of \(\Sigma_g\) for \(g \geq 2\) is the half-plane. This means we have a holomorphic (locally biholomorphic) covering map \(p:\mathbb{H}\to\Sigma_g\). Suppose we have a holomorphic map \(f:\mathbb{C}\to\Sigma_g\). Then, since \(\mathbb{C}\) is simply connected, by the topological map lifting lemma we have a continuous function \(F\) such that \(f=p\circ F\). Since \(p\) is locally biholomorphic, this means that \(F=p^{-1}\circ f\) locally, and thus \(F\) is holomorphic. Therefore we have a holomorphic function \(F:\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{H}\).</p><p>(this proof is much clearer with a diagram but I can&apos;t draw those here yet) </p><p>\[\]</p><p> By the Riemann mapping theorem, there exist a biholomorphism \(g:\mathbb{H}\to D\), the unit disk (this is also a simple Mobius transformation but why not use the Riemann mapping theorem since we can?). Thus \(g\circ F\) is a holomorphic function from \(\mathbb{C}\) to \(D\). In other words, \(|g\circ F(z)|&lt;1\) for all \(z\in\mathbb{C}\) and is thus a bounded entire function. Thus \(g\circ F\) is constant by Liouvilleâ€™s theorem. We know that \(g\) is already a biholomorphism, so \(F\) is constant. That means \(f\) is constant as well.</p></solution><topics><MobiusTransformation/><PointSetTopology/><RiemannSurfaces/><Liouville/></topics><instructors><a/></instructors>
