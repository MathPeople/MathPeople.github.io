<problem><p>Suppose \(\mathcal{F}\) is a family of analytic functions defined on a region \(\Omega\). Let \(\mathcal{F}&apos;\) be the family of derivatives of \(\mathcal{F}\),</p><p>\[\mathcal{F}&apos;=\{f&apos;|f\in\mathcal{F}\}\]</p><p>Prove that \(\mathcal{F}\) normal \(\implies\mathcal{F}&apos;\) normal. Prove or disprove the converse, \(\mathcal{F}&apos;\) normal \(\implies\mathcal{F}\) normal.</p></problem><solution><p>By Montel&apos;s theorem this is equivalent to showing that \(\mathcal{F}&apos;\) is locally bounded. By assumption (and Montel&apos;s theorem) \(\mathcal{F}\) is locally bounded. Let \(z_0\in\Omega\) and choose \(M,\delta&gt;0\) for the local bounded property, i.e. \(\{z:|z-z_0|\leq\delta\}\subset\Omega\) and for all \(f\in\mathcal{F}\) and all \(z\) with \(|z-z_0|&lt;\delta\), \(|f(z)|\leq M\). Then by Cauchy&apos;s integral formula</p><p>\[|f&apos;(z_0)|=\left|2\pi i\int_{|z-z_0|=\delta}\frac{f(z)}{(z-z_0)^2}dz\right|\leq2\pi\int_{|z-z_0|=\delta}\frac{M}{\delta^2}|dz|=\frac{4\pi^2M}{\delta}\]</p><p>Thus \(\mathcal{F}&apos;\) is bounded in the \(\delta\)-neighborhood of \(z_0\) by \(\frac{4\pi^2M}{\delta}\), so \(\mathcal{F}&apos;\) is locally bounded. </p><p> The converse is not true, take \(\mathcal{F}\) to be all constant functions. Then \(\mathcal{F}&apos;=\{0\}\) is certainly normal but the sequence of \(f_n\in\mathcal{F}\) given by \(f_n=n\) does not converge to a holomorphic function.</p></solution><topics><IntegralEstimates/><CauchyIntegralFormula/><SequenceOfFunctions/><Montel/></topics><instructors><a/><b/></instructors>
