Moreover, if there is a point \(a\in G\) with \(|f(a)|=\sup_G|f(z)|\), then \(f\) must be constant on \(\Omega\).</p><p>Let \(B_r=\{z:|z|&lt;r\}\) and \(C_r=\{z:|z|=r\}\). Then for all \(r\) with \(0\leq r&lt;R\), we know \(\overline{B_r}\subset B_R\). By the maximum modulus principle, </p><p>\[\sup_{z\in B_r}|f(z)|=\sup_{z\in C_r}|f(z)|=M(r)\]</p><p> The left hand side clearly is a nondecreasing function of \(r\) because \(B_r\) is a larger set as \(r\) gets larger. That shows that \(M\) is nondecreasing. Moreover, if there are two points \(r_1&lt;r_2\) for which \(M(r_1)=M(r_2)\) then there is a point \(a\in \overline{B_{r_1}}\subset B_{\frac{1}{2}(r_1+r_2)}\) with \(|f(a)|=\sup_{B_{r_2}}|f(z)|\). By the maximum modulus principle, \(f\) must then be constant on \(B_{r_2}\). The uniqueness principle then forces \(f\) to be constant on \(B_R\). </p><p>\[\]</p><p> The fact that \(M\) is continuous follows from the fact that \(f\) is continuous, but we will give some details there now. We already know that \(M\) is an increasing function, we just need to show it does not jump. Let \(0\leq s&lt;R\) and \(\delta&gt;0\) be given. Let \(\epsilon&apos;&gt;0\) be small enough that \(s+\epsilon&apos;&lt;R\). Let \(B=\{z:|z|&lt;s+\epsilon&apos;\}\). Then \(|f|:\overline{B}\to[0,\infty)\) is a uniformly continuous function (uniformly because of compactness). Let \(\epsilon&gt;0\) be small enough that for any \(z,w\in B\) with \(|z-w|&lt;\epsilon\), \(|f(z)-f(w)|&lt;\delta\). Also choose \(\epsilon&lt;\epsilon&apos;\). Now we show \(M\) does not jump at \(s\). For any \(z\) with \(s&lt;|z|&lt;s+\epsilon\), there is a \(w\) with \(|w|=s\) and \(|w-z|&lt;\epsilon\). Then \(|f(z)-f(w)|&lt;\delta\), so </p><p>\[|f(z)|-|f(w)|\leq|f(z)-f(w)|&lt;\delta\]</p><p> </p><p>\[|f(z)|&lt;|f(w)|+\delta\leq M(s)+\delta\]</p><p> because \(w\in C_s\). This last inequality shoes that for all \(s&apos;\) with \(s&lt;s&apos;&lt;s+\epsilon\), </p><p>\[M(s&apos;)&lt;M(s)+\delta\]</p><p> Thus \(M\) does not jump past \(\delta\) at \(s\). This is for all \(\delta&gt;0\), so \(M\) does not jump at \(s\). This is for all \(s\), so \(M\) never jumps. Thus \(M\) is continuous.</p></solution><topics><PointSetTopology/><FunctionBounds/><UniquenessPrinciple/><MaxMod/></topics><instructors><a/><c/></instructors>
