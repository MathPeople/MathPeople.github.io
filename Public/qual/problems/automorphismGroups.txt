<problem><p>Let \(\Omega\) be a region. Recall an automorphism of \(\Omega\) is a biholomorphism from \(\Omega\) to \(\Omega\). The set of automorphisms forms a group under composition, currently we only care because we like the term &quot;automorphism group of \(\Omega\).&quot;</p><p>We say the automorphism group of \(\Omega\) is transitive if for each \(x,y\in\Omega\) there is an automorphism \(\phi_{x,y}\) such that \(\phi_{x,y}(x)=y\). We say the automorphism group is spin-transitive if for all \(x,y\in\Omega\) and \(\lambda\in\mathbb{C}^*\), there is an automorphism \(\phi_{x,y}^\lambda\) such that \(\phi_{x,y}^\lambda(x)=y\) and </p><p>\[\frac{\left(\phi_{x,y}^\lambda\right)&apos;(x)}{\lambda}&gt;0\]</p><p>That is, the derivative at \(x\) points in the same direction as \(\lambda\). Note that the derivative of an automorphism cannot vanish.</p><p>Let \(\Omega\) be a simply connected region. Prove the automorphism group of \(\Omega\) is spin transitive. What about if \(\Omega\) is the annulus \(A=1&lt;|z|&lt;2\)?</p></problem><solution><p>If \(\Omega\) is a simply connected region, then either \(\Omega=\mathbb{C}\) or not. In the first case, affine linear maps provide enough automorphisms of \(\Omega\) to prove the result. Concretely, \(\phi_{x,y}^\lambda(z)=\lambda(z-x)+y\). If \(\Omega\neq\mathbb{C}\) then \(\Omega\) is biholomorphic to \(\mathbb{D}\) by the Riemann mapping theorem. Mobius transformations combined with rotations provide enough automorphisms of the disc to conclude that the automorphism group of the disc is spin-transitive, and this property is preserved under biholomorphism. We can fix a biholomorphism from \(\Omega\) to \(\mathbb{D}\), trace out the desired behavior in \(\mathbb{D}\), obtain that behavior with an automorphism of the disc, and then pull it back to \(\Omega\) via the biholomorphism. We omit the details at present.</p><p>For the annulus, the automorphism group is much smaller. We presume that we know any automorphism of \(A\) extends continuously to the boundary (I&apos;m stil not quite sure how this works, see Kellogg&apos;s theorem), whence it must take the boundary to the boundary. Moreover it either exchanges the two circles or not. If the circles were exchanged we can compose with \(\frac{1}{2z}\) to unexchange the circles, so we investigate now all automorphisms of \(A\) which do not exchange the boundary circles.</p><p>Suppose \(\phi:A\to A\) is an automorphism which does not exchange the two boundary circles. Then the function \(\frac{\phi(z)}{z}:A\to\mathbb{C}\) is holomorphic. Moreover, for all \(z\in\partial A\),</p><p>\[\left|\frac{\phi(z)}{z}\right|=\frac{|\phi(z)|}{|z|}=1\]</p><p>precisely because the circles are not exchanged. By the maximum principle applied to the real and imaginary parts of \(\frac{\phi(z)}{z}\), this function must be constant because it is constant on the boundary. Thus \(\phi(z)=\lambda z\) with \(|\lambda|=1\), so \(\phi\) is just a rotation.</p><p>We conclude by recognizing that we have shown any automorphism of \(A\) is either a rotation or \(\frac{1}{2z}\) followed by a rotation. This is too restrictive for the automorphism group to be transitive, we can see this because any automorphism fixes the circle \(|z|=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\). Clearly rotations fix this circle, and \(\frac{1}{2z}\) fixes this circle as well. Thus \(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\) can never be sent to \(\frac{3}{2}\) via an automorphism of \(A\), so the automorphism group is not transitive.</p></solution><topics><PointSetTopology/><MobiusTransformation/><Harmonic/><MaximumPrinciple/><RiemannMapping/></topics><instructors><e/></instructors>
