<problem><p>Let \(\gamma\) be a piecewise differentiable curve and let \(\overline\gamma\) be the image of \(\gamma\) under conjugation. If \(f\) is continuous, show that \(z\mapsto\overline{f(\overline z)}\) is also continuous and that</p><p>\[\int_\gamma f(z)dz=\overline{\int_\overline\gamma\overline{f(\overline{z})}dz}\]</p></problem><solution><p>First, conjugation is continuous and the composition of continuous maps is continuous so \(z\mapsto\overline{f(\overline z)}\) is continuous. Write the left hand side as a path integral,</p><p>\[\int_\gamma f(z)dz=\int_a^bf(\gamma(t))\gamma&apos;(t)dt\]</p><p>Recall the path integral operation respects conjugation, giving </p><p>\[\int_a^bf(\gamma(t))\gamma&apos;(t)dt=\overline{\int_a^b\overline{f(\gamma(t))}\overline{\gamma&apos;(t)}dt}\]</p><p> This comes from the definition of the integral as a limit of Riemann sums. From here we will change our coordinates so we follow \(\overline\gamma\) instead of \(\gamma\). Note that a calculation with Jacobians shows that </p><p>\[(\overline\gamma)&apos;(t)=\overline{\gamma&apos;(t)}\]</p><p> Also recall \(\overline{(\overline\gamma)(t)}=\gamma(t)\). Then </p><p>\[\overline{\int_a^b\overline{f(\gamma(t))}\overline{\gamma&apos;(t)}dt}=\overline{\int_a^b\overline{f(\overline{\overline\gamma(t)})}\overline\gamma&apos;(t)dt}\]</p><p> But this is exactly the path integral version of the right hand side, so we are done.</p></solution><topics><Conjugation/></topics><instructors><a/><c/></instructors>
