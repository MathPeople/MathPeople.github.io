<problem><p>Determine explicitly the largest disc about the origin where the mapping \(f(z)=z^2-2z\) is injective. Justify your answer.</p></problem><solution><p>Suppose \(f(z)=a\). Then</p><p>\[z^2-2z=a\]</p><p>\[z^2-2z+1=a+1\]</p><p>By the fundamental theorem of algebra there is a complex number \(b\) with \(b^2=a+1\). Take such a \(b\).</p><p>\[(z-1)^2=b^2\]</p><p>\[z=1\pm b\]</p><p>Unless \(b=0\) (which is only when \(a=-1\)), there are two distinct preimages of \(a\) under \(f\). Moreover these two roots are symmetric centered around \(1\), as in \(1\) is the midpoint between the two roots. Thus the largest desired radius is 1. For any \(z\) with \(|z|&lt;1\) the only other point \(w\) with \(f(z)=f(w)\) is \(w=1-z\), which necessarily has \(|w|&gt;1\), and any neighborhood of \(1\) has two distinct points which get sent to the same value under \(f\).</p></solution><topics><FundamentalTheoremOfAlgebra/><ElementaryDefinitions/></topics><instructors><c/><f/></instructors>
