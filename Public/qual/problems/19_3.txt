<problem><p>Let \(a\in G\) for some region \(G\). Suppose \(f\) is continuous on \(G\) and analytic on \(G\setminus\{a\}\). Prove \(f\) is analytic at \(a\).</p></problem><solution><p>Assume \(f\) is not constant, for the result is trivial if it is. Using translations and rescalings we can assume, without loss of generality, that \(G=\mathbb{D}\), \(a=0\), and there is some \(M&gt;0\) such that \(|f(z)|&lt;M\) for all \(|z|&lt;1\). Note \(f&apos;\) is defined on \(\mathbb{D}^*=\mathbb{D}\setminus\{0\}\). First we produce a bound for \(f&apos;\) near \(0\). Let \(a\) have \(0&lt;|a|&lt;\frac{1}{2}\) and let \(\gamma\) trace out the circle \(|z-a|=\frac{|a|}{2}\). By Cauchy&apos;s integral formula</p><p>\[|f&apos;(a)|=\frac{1}{2\pi}\left|\int_\gamma\frac{f(z)}{(z-a)^2}dz\right|\leq\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_\gamma\frac{|f(z)|}{|z-a|^2}|dz|\leq\frac{1}{2\pi}\frac{M}{\frac{|a|^2}{4}}2\pi\frac{|a|}{2}=\frac{2M}{|a|}\]</p><p>Let \(g:\mathbb{D}^*\to\mathbb{C}\) be defined by</p><p>\[g(z)=z^2f(z)\]</p><p>Then for any \(z\) with \(0&lt;|z|&lt;1\),</p><p>\[g&apos;(z)=2zf(z)+z^2f&apos;(z)\]</p><p>By the bound produced above, \(z^2f&apos;\) and therefore \(g&apos;\) is continuous at \(0\) (taking \(0\) to \(0\)). Then \(g\) is analytic on the disc. Moreover both \(g\) and \(g&apos;\) vanish at the origin, so \(g\) has a root of order at least 2 there. By the degree argument there is a natural number \(d\geq2\) and an analytic \(h\) such that</p><p>\[g(z)=z^dh(z)\]</p><p>on all of \(\mathbb{D}\). Then \(f=z^{d-2}h\), so \(f\) is analytic on \(\mathbb{D}\).</p></solution><topics><CauchyIntegralFormula/><IntegralEstimates/><FunctionBounds/><ClassificationOfSingularities/><Degree/></topics><instructors><c/><f/></instructors>
