<problem><p>A \(C^2\) function of two real variables \(u(x,y)\), defined on a region \(G\), is harmonic if</p><p>\[\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial y^2}=0\]</p><p>Prove that if \(u\) is harmonic then \(u\) is smooth (\(C^\infty\)).</p></problem><solution><p>On simply connected regions, harmonic functions have harmonic conjugates. Let \(z\in G\) and let \(B\) be a ball around \(z\) which is contained in \(G\). On \(B\), \(u\) has a harmonic conjugate \(v\) such that \(f(z)=u(x,y)+iv(x,y)\) is holomorphic. Note that \(f\) is only defined on \(B\). However, smoothness is only a local property. Holomorphic functions are analytic and analytic functions are smooth, so \(f\) is smooth. That forces \(u\) to be smooth at \(z\). This is true for all \(z\in G\), so \(u\) is smooth.</p></solution><topics><Harmonic/><HarmonicConjugate/><HolomorphicMeansAnalytic/></topics><instructors><a/><b/></instructors>
