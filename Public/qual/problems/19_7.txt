<problem><p>(a) Show that any compact Riemann surface admits a branched cover over the Riemann sphere. (b) Let \(M\) be a compact Riemann surface of genus 5. Suppose \(F\) is a branched cover from \(M\) to \(S^2\). Prove that \(R=2(4+r)\), where \(R=\) the total ramification index of \(F\) , \(r=\) number of sheets of the cover.</p></problem><solution notWrittenYet=""></solution><topics><RiemannSurfaces/></topics>
