<problem><p>Prove that there exists no non-constant holomorphic function on a compact Riemann surface \(M\).</p></problem><solution><p>Let \(f:M\to\mathbb{C}\) be a holomorphic function. Then since \(f\) is continuous, we also know \(|f|:M\to\mathbb{R}\) is continuous. Since \(M\) is a compact Riemann surface and \(|f|\) is continuous, there exists a point \(p \in M\) where \(|f|\) achieves a maximum at \(p\). Let \(U\) be a chart of \(M\) containing the point \(p\). Then by the maximum modulus principle, \(f\) is constant on \(U\). Take two distinct points \(p \neq q \in M\). Since \(M\) is path connected, there exists a path from \(q\) to \(p\). We may form an open cover of \(M\) consisting of charts which cover the path joining \(q\) to \(p\). Since this path is compact, there exists a finite subcover. By the uniqueness/identity theorem for holomorphic functions, this implies \(f\) is constant on all these charts. Since \(p\) and \(q\) are arbitrary, we can repeat this argument as many times as needed for the whole Riemann surface \(M\). Thus \(f(p) = f(q)\) for all \(p\) and \(q\). Thus \(f\) is constant on all of \(M\).</p></solution><topics><PointSetTopology/><UniquenessPrinciple/><RiemannSurfaces/><MaxMod/></topics><instructors><a/></instructors>
