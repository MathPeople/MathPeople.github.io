<problem><p>Let \(f\) be an entire function such that \(|f(z)|&lt;M|z|^\alpha\) for all \(z\in\mathbb{C}\), where \(M,R,\alpha\) are constants and \(0&lt;\alpha&lt;1\). Prove \(f\) is constant.</p></problem><solution><p>Let \(z_0\in\mathbb{C}\). Take the power series of \(f\) centered at \(0\),</p><p>\[f(z)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}z^n\]</p><p>Let \(R&gt;0\) and rewrite the coefficients using Cauchy&apos;s integral formula, </p><p>\[f^{(n)}(0)=\frac{n!}{2\pi i}\int_{|w|=R}\frac{f(w)}{w^{n+1}}dw\]</p><p> Using the assumption that \(|f(w)|&lt;M|w|^\alpha\) gives </p><p>\[|f^{(n)}(0)|\leq\frac{n!}{2\pi}\int_{|w|=R}\frac{MR^\alpha}{R^{n+1}}|dw|=\frac{n!M}{R^{n+1-\alpha}}\]</p><p> Now \(n\geq0\) and \(\alpha&lt;1\) so \(n+1-\alpha&gt;0\). Thus \(\frac{n!M}{R^{n+1-\alpha}}\to0\) as \(R\to\infty\). We are using the fact that \(f\) is entire when we let \(R\to\infty\). Thus \(f^{(n)}(0)=0\) for all \(n\geq0\), meaning all coefficients in the power series are \(0\), so \(f\) is constantly 0. </p><p> Note that we showed \(f=0\), which is stronger than \(f\) is constant. That is because of the way this question is worded, in fact \(|f(0)|\leq M|0|^\alpha=0\) so \(f\) being constant implies that \(f\) is \(0\) under this bound.</p></solution><topics><IntegralEstimates/><CauchyIntegralFormula/><SumConvergence/><EntireFunction/><CauchyEstimate/></topics><instructors><a/><b/></instructors>
