<problem><p>Let \(\{f_n\}\) be a sequence of analytic functions on a region \(\Omega\) which converges uniformly to a function \(f\). Prove that \(f\) is also analytic.</p><p>Let \(\{f_n^{(k)}\}\) be the sequence of \(k^{th}\) derivatives of \(f_n\). Show that, on every closed disc \(\overline{B_r(a)}\subset\Omega, f_n^{(k)}\) converges uniformly to \(f^{(k)}\).</p></problem><solution><p>Let \(\gamma\) be any closed path in \(\Omega\) which encircles only points also in \(\Omega\). By Cauchy&apos;s integral theorem,</p><p>\[\int_\gamma f_n(z)dz=0\]</p><p> Then uniform convergence means we can swap integral and limit, so </p><p>\[\int_\gamma f(z)dz=\lim\int_\gamma f_n(z)dz=0\]</p><p> Thus \(f\) is analytic by Morera&apos;s theorem. Moreover, by Cauchy&apos;s integral formula (\(z_0\in\Omega\) and \(\gamma\) is a small loop around \(z_0\)) </p><p>\[f^{(k)}(z)=\frac{k!}{2\pi i}\int_\gamma\frac{f(z)}{(z-z_0)^{k+1}}dz=\lim\frac{k!}{2\pi i}\int_\gamma\frac{f_n(z)}{(z-z_0)^{k+1}}dz=f_n^{(k)}(z_0)\]</p><p> Uniform convergence for the middle equality above comes from the fact that \(f_n\) converges uniformly to begin with, and the fact that \(\overline{B_r(a)}\) is compact.</p></solution><topics><IntegralEstimates/><SequenceOfFunctions/><CauchyIntegralFormula/><Morera/></topics><instructors><a/><c/></instructors>
