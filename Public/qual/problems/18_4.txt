<problem><p>Let \(G\) be a region in \(\mathbb{R}^2\). Suppose \(u:G\to\mathbb{R}\) is a continuous function which satisfies the mean value property. Prove \(u\) is harmonic.</p></problem><solution><p>First we will show that \(u\) satisfies the maximum principle. Suppose there is a point \(a\in G\) with \(u(a)\geq u(z)\) for all \(|z-a|&lt;r\) where \(r&gt;0\) is small enough that \(|z-a|\leq r\implies z\in G\). By the mean value property,</p><p>\[u(a)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^\pi u(a+re^{it})dt\leq\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^\pi u(a)dt=u(a)\]</p><p>There is a fact in analysis that if a continuous function \(\phi\) has \(\phi\geq0\) and \(\int\phi=0\) then \(\phi=0\). This is proven by shwoing \(\phi&gt;\delta&gt;0\) on a neighborhood of some point where \(\phi&gt;0\). We use this fact on the integral </p><p>\[\int_{-\pi}^\pi u(a)-u(a+re^{it})dt=0\]</p><p> The inside is nonnegative by the maximum assumption, so \(u(a)=u(a+re^{it})\) for all \(t\). This also works for any \(r\) small enough that the ball of radius \(r\) centered at \(a\) fits in our region, so we have proven that \(u\) is constant near \(a\). Thus we have shown that \(u\) satisfies the maximum principle. </p><p>Now that we know \(u\) satisfies the maximum principle, let \(a\in G\) and let \(r&gt;0\) be small enough that the ball \(B\) centered at \(a\) of radius \(r\) is in \(G\). Let \(v\) be the solution to the Dirichlet problem which agrees with \(u\) on the boundary of \(B\),</p><p>\[v(a+se^{i\theta})=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^\pi P_s(\theta-t)u(a+re^{it})dt\]</p><p> Then \(v\) is harmonic, so it satisfies the maximum principle as well. Moreover the function \(u-v\) also satisfies the maximum principle.The function \(u-v\) is constantly \(0\) on the boundary of \(B\), though, so \(u-v\leq0\) inside \(B\). The same argument shows \(v-u\leq0\) inside \(B\) as well, so \(u-v=0\) in \(B\). That is, \(u=v\). Now we know \(v\) is harmonic because that&apos;s the point of the Dirichlet problem, so \(u\) is also harmonic at \(a\). Repeating for any \(a\) shows that \(u\) is a harmonic function.</p></solution><topics><IntegralEstimates/><MeanValueProperty/><Harmonic/><MaximumPrinciple/><DirichletProblem/></topics><instructors><a/><b/></instructors>
