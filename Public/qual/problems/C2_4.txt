<problem><p>Let \(\alpha = f(z)dz\) be a non-trivial meromorphic one-form on a compact Riemann surface \(M\). Prove that the number of zeroes minus the number of poles of \(\alpha\) counted according to multiplicity, is equal to \(2g-2\), where \(g\) is the genus of \(M\).</p></problem><solution><p>Let \(\mathcal{Z}\) denote the number of zeroes of \(\alpha\) and \(\mathcal{P}\) denote the number of poles of \(\alpha\) (counted according to multiplicities).</p><p>The idea is to modify the meromorphic one form \(\alpha\). We can&apos;t immediately apply the Hopf principle since \(\alpha\) might have poles. We want to create a smooth one form \(\tilde{\alpha}\) which has only isolated zeroes. Let \(\omega = R(x,y)dx \wedge dy\) be a volume form where \(R &gt; 0\), \(|\alpha|^2 = \frac{1}{R}\). </p><p>\[\]</p><p> Now let \(p\) be a pole of \(\alpha\). Choose a smooth real valued function \(p:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}\), such that \(p(t) = 1\) for small \(t\) and \(p(t) = \frac{1}{t}\) for large \(t\). This is is essentially a bump function. Let \(\tilde{\alpha} = p(|\alpha|^2)\alpha\). This is a smooth 1-form which is globally defined on \(M\). Moreover, locally around the pole \(p\): </p><p>\[\tilde{\alpha} = \frac{1}{|\alpha|^2}\alpha = \frac{R}{|f(z)|^2}f(z)dz = \frac{R}{f(z) \overline{f(z)}}f(z)dz =^* R(\overline{\frac{1}{f(z)}})dz\]</p><p> Note that \(\overline{\frac{1}{f(z)}}\) tends to a zero with the same order as the pole. Moreover, the sign of the multiplicity also changes. This can be done for every pole of \(\tilde{\alpha}\). Thus by the Hopf principle for this 1 form, we get </p><p>\[\mathcal{Z} - \mathcal{P} = -\chi(M) = 2g-2\]</p></solution><topics><Conjugation/><RiemannSurfaces/><DifferentialForms/><HopfPrinciple/><Meromorphic/></topics><instructors><a/></instructors>
