<problem><p>Let \(D\subseteq\mathbb{C}\) be an open connected subset of \(\mathbb{C}\). Let \(f,g\) be holomorphic functions on \(D\) such that \(f(z)\neq0\neq g(z)\) for all \(z\in D\). Let \(\{a_n\}\) be a sequence of points in \(D\) with a limit \(a\) such that \(\forall n, a_n\neq a\). Suppose</p><p>\[\frac{f&apos;(a_n)}{f(a_n)}=\frac{g&apos;(a_n)}{g(a_n)}\]</p><p>for all \(n\). Show there is a constant \(c\) such that \(f=cg\).</p></problem><solution><p>The functions \(\frac{f&apos;}{f}\) and \(\frac{g&apos;}{g}\) are holomorphic in \(D\) because \(f\) and \(g\) never vanish. The fact that \(\frac{f&apos;}{f}\) and \(\frac{g&apos;}{g}\) agree on a set which has a limit point in \(D\) means, by the uniqueness principle, that they agree on all of \(D\). That is, \(f&apos;g=g&apos;f\). Take the function \(\frac{f}{g}\). It is holomorphic because again \(g\) never vanishes. Its derivative is</p><p>\[\left(\frac{f}{g}\right)&apos;=\frac{f&apos;g-g&apos;f}{g^2}=0\]</p><p>Then \(\frac{f}{g}\) is a constant \(c\), so \(f=cg\).</p></solution><topics><UniquenessPrinciple/></topics><instructors><a/><c/></instructors>
