Then \(p\) has a root, i.e. there is some \(a\in\mathbb{C}\) for which \(p(a)=0\).</p></problem><solution><p>Suppose \(p\) is a polynomial defined on \(\mathbb{C}\) with no roots. We will show \(p\) must be constant.</p><p>If \(p\) has no roots, then the function \(\frac{1}{p}\) is entire. Either \(p\) is a constant or \(|p(z)|\to\infty\) as \(|z|\to\infty\), either way \(\frac{1}{p}\) is bounded. By Liouville's theorem, \(\frac{1}{p}\) is constant. That is only possible if \(p\) is also constant.</p><p>\[\]</p><p>By contrapositive, if we assume \(p\) is nonconstant then \(p\) must have a root.</p></solution>
