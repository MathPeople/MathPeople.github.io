<theorem>Poisson Kernel</theorem><problem><p>This is for the Dirichlet problem on the unit disc. That is, given a function \(f:\{|z|=1\}\to\mathbb{R}\) we are looking for a function \(u:\{|z|\leq1\}\to\mathbb{R}\) such that \(u\) is harmonic on the interior of the disc and \(u=f\) where \(f\) is defined.</p></problem><solution><p>It turns out this is possible for so many functions \(f\) that deciding what regularity we need is not what we are going to care about. Just consider \(f\) to be a non-diabolical function. Then the Dirichlet problem is solvable using the Poisson kernel.</p><p>The poisson kernel is a function from the unit disc to \(\mathbb{R}\) given in polar coordinates by</p><p>\[P_r(\theta)=\frac{1-r^2}{1-2r\cos(\theta)+r^2}=Re\left(\frac{1+re^{i\theta}}{1-re^{i\theta}}\right)=\cdots\]</p><p>\[\]There are many forms of the Poisson kernel. It is useful because the Dirichlet solution is given by\[u(re^{i\theta})=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^\pi P_r(\theta-t)f(e^{it})dt\]</p></solution>
