<theorem>Arzela Ascoli Theorem</theorem><problem><p>A family \(\mathcal{F}\subset\mathcal{H}(\Omega)\) is normal if and only if the following two conditions hold:</p><p>\[1:\text{ For each }z\in\Omega\text{, the set }\{f(z):f\in\mathcal{F}\}\text{ has compact closure in }\mathbb{C}\]</p><p>\[2: \mathcal{F}\text{ is equicontinuous at all points in }\Omega\]</p></problem><solution><p>I doubt the proof will ever end up on a test so I won't bother to write it now. If you want to see it and can't follow Conway's proof then let me know.</p></solution>
