<theorem>Schwarz Lemma</theorem><problem><p>Let \(\Omega\) be a region containing the closed unit disc \(\overline D\) and suppose \(f:\Omega\to\mathbb{C}\) is holomorphic and satisfies \(|f(z)|\leq1\) for all \(z\in\overline D\). Suppose also that \(f(0)=0\). Then \(|f(z)|\leq|z|\) for all \(z\in\overline D\), \(|f&apos;(0)|\leq1\), and if equality holds in either case then \(f(z)=\lambda z\) for some constant \(\lambda\).</p></problem><solution><p>Consider the function \(g(z)=\frac{f(z)}{z}\). By assumption, \(0\) is a root of \(f\) which means \(g\) is holomorphic. The maximum modulus principle means that the maximum of \(g\) occurs on its boundary. On the boundary \(|z|=1\),</p><p>\[|g(z)|=\left|\frac{f(z)}{z}\right|=|f(z)|\leq1\]</p><p>Thus for all \(z\in\overline D\)\[|g(z)|\leq1\]If \(z\neq0\) then multiplying by \(|z|\) gives\[|f(z)|\leq|z|\]At \(z=0\), \(g(0)=f&apos;(0)\) by definition of the difference quotient. Thus \(|f&apos;(0)|\leq1\). If equality holds in either case then \(g\) is constant by the maximum modulus principle. That shows the result.</p></solution>
