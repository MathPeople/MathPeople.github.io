# UCRQualPrep
MathPeople is a group of mathematicians using gitHub to do some math. This site was created for hosting qual prep seminars, but room is left to include other uses should any be found.

For seminar hosts -- there will be instructions on how to maintain the site and how to make your own seminar's site using the infrastructure here.
