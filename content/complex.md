# Complex Qual Prep Seminar Site 

Use the metainformation box below to filter which problems are shown. See the [XPath](https://github.com/MathPeople/MathPeople.github.io/wiki/XPath) wiki for an overview of the process. To see some short and useful examples, replacing the asterisk by `//topics/RiemannSurfaces` and hitting enter will cause only problems about Riemann surfaces to appear. Use an asterisk, `*` in the second bar to display all problems.
