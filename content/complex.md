		<summary><strong>ArgumentPrinciple:</strong> Let $\Omega$ be a region and suppose $f$ is a meromorphic function on $\Omega$. Let $\gamma$ be a positively oriented simple closed curve which does not pass through any zeroes or poles of $f$. Then<br>\[\int_\gamma\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}dz=(2\pi i)(Z-P)\]<br>where $Z,P$ are the numbers of zeroes and poles of $f$, respectively, which lie in the region bounded by $\gamma$.<br>Note that by the chain rule (u-substitution),<br>\[\int_\gamma\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}dz=\int_{f\circ\gamma}\frac{1}{z}dz\]<br>is simply the winding number of the image of $\gamma$ around the origin.<br><br></summary>
		<p><strong>Solution: </strong>Factor the zeroes and poles of $f$ to get<br>\[f(z)=g(z)\prod_{i=1}^n(z-z_i)\prod_{j=1}^m\frac{1}{z-p_j}.\]<br>Here $z_1,\ldots,z_n$ are the zeroes of $f$ and $p_1,\ldots,p_m$ are the poles. Note that $g$ has no roots or poles inside $\gamma$. Compute the logarithmic derivative of $f$, not $f'$ directly:<br>\[\frac{f'(z_0)}{f(z_0)}=\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\ln(f(z))|_{z=z_0}\]<br>\[\ln(f(z))=\ln(g(z))+\sum_{i=1}^n\ln(z-z_i)-\sum_{j-1}^m\ln(z-p_j).\]<br>Then take the integral<br>\[\int_\gamma(\ln(f(z))'dz=\int_\gamma(\ln(g(z))'dz+\sum_{i=1}^n\int_\gamma(\ln(z-z_i))'dz-\sum_{j-1}^m\int_\gamma(\ln(z-p_j))'dz\]<br>\[=\int_\gamma\frac{g'(z)}{g(z)}dz+\sum_{i=1}^n\int_\gamma\frac{1}{z-z_i}dz-\sum_{j=1}^m\frac{1}{z-p_j}dz.\]<br>Recall $g$ has no poles or roots inside $\gamma$, so $\frac{g'}{g}$ is a holomorphic function inside $\gamma$. Thus by Cauchy's integral theorem $\int_\gamma\frac{g'(z)}{g(z)}dz=0$. The rest of the terms pick up a copy of $2\pi i$ for each term because $\int_{|z|=1}\frac{1}{z}dz=2\pi i$. Thus<br>\[\int_\gamma\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}dz=0+\sum_{i=1}^n(2\pi i)-\sum_{j=1}^m(2\pi i)=2\pi i(n-m)\]<br>which is the statement.<br>Note that you can replace $f(z)$ by $f(z)-a$ to count poles and preimages of $a$, just use the argument principle on $g(z)=f(z)-a$.</p>

		<summary><strong>ArzelaAscoli:</strong> A family $\mathcal{F}\subset\mathcal{H}(\Omega)$ is normal if and only if the following two conditions hold:<br>\[1:\text{ For each }z\in\Omega\text{, the set }\{f(z):f\in\mathcal{F}\}\text{ has compact closure in }\mathbb{C}\]<br>\[2: \mathcal{F}\text{ is equicontinuous at all points in }\Omega\]<br><br></summary>

		<summary><strong>C1_1:</strong> Prove that a Riemann surface $M$ is orientable.<br><br></summary>
		<p><strong>Solution: </strong>Recall that $M$ is orientable if we are able to choose local coordinates $\{U, \tilde{\varphi} \}$, $\{V, \varphi \}$ such that $\det(J(\tilde{\varphi} \circ \varphi^{-1})) > 0$ for all transition functions $\tilde{\varphi} \circ \varphi^{-1}$. We can write the transition maps as $\tilde{\varphi} \circ \varphi^{-1} = \mu(x,y) + i <br>u(x,y)$. The Jacobian is a $2$ by $2$ matrix so we have<br>\[N := J(\tilde{\varphi} \circ \varphi^{-1}) = \left[ {\begin{array}{cc} \frac{\partial\mu}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial \mu}{\partial y} \\ \frac{\partial<br>u}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial<br>u}{\partial y} \\ \end{array} } \right]\]<br>First, note that since $M$ is a Riemann surface, the transition functions are holomorphic and therefore satisfy the Cauchy Riemann equations. Second, note that transition maps are nonsingular so the determinant is nonzero. Then we get <br>\[\det(N) = \frac{\partial\mu}{\partial x}\frac{\partial<br>u}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial\mu}{\partial y}\frac{\partial<br>u}{\partial x} = \left(\frac{\partial \mu}{\partial x}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\partial\mu}{\partial y}\right)^2 > 0 \]<br> Hence $M$ is orientable.</p>

		<summary><strong>C1_2:</strong> Prove that there exists no non-constant holomorphic function on a compact Riemann surface $M$.<br><br></summary>
		<p><strong>Solution: </strong>Let $f:M\to\mathbb{C}$ be a holomorphic function. Then since $f$ is continuous, we also know $|f|:M\to\mathbb{R}$ is continuous. Since $M$ is a compact Riemann surface and $|f|$ is continuous, there exists a point $p \in M$ where $|f|$ achieves a maximum at $p$. Let $U$ be a chart of $M$ containing the point $p$. Then by the maximum modulus principle, $f$ is constant on $U$. Take two distinct points $p \neq q \in M$. Since $M$ is path connected, there exists a path from $q$ to $p$. We may form an open cover of $M$ consisting of charts which cover the path joining $q$ to $p$. Since this path is compact, there exists a finite subcover. By the uniqueness/identity theorem for holomorphic functions, this implies $f$ is constant on all these charts. Since $p$ and $q$ are arbitrary, we can repeat this argument as many times as needed for the whole Riemann surface $M$. Thus $f(p) = f(q)$ for all $p$ and $q$. Thus $f$ is constant on all of $M$.</p>

		<summary><strong>C1_3:</strong> Show that the set of points $(z,w) \in \mathbb{C}^2$ with $w^2 = \sin(z)$, call it $N$, is naturally a Riemann surface.<br><br></summary>
		<p><strong>Solution: </strong> One can show that $N$ is a smoothly embedded submanifold of $\mathbb{C}^2$ with dimension 2 by considering the map $f(w,z) = w^2 - \sin(z)$ and showing 0 is a regular value so that $N = f^{-1}(0)$. For our interests, we want to show that $N$ has a complex structure.<br>Observe that for each $(w_0, z_0) \in N$, at least one of the partial derivatives for $f$ ($f_w = 2w$, $f_z = -\cos(z)$) does not vanish. If we chose a point of $N$ where $f_w$ does not vanish, then by theorem 1 (pg 5 in Donaldson), we can find discs $D_1$, $D_2$, and a holomorphic map $\phi:D_1\to D_2$ such that $N \cap (D_1 \times D_2) = \{(z, \phi(z)) \}$ (graph of $\phi$). We can make coordinate charts $U_\alpha = N \cap (D_1 \times D_2)$ with $\tilde{U_\alpha} = D_1$ and $\psi_\alpha$ the restriction of projection from $D_1 \times D_2 $ to $D_1$. Similarly, if we chose a point where $f_z$ doesnt vanish, we can find discs $B_1, B_2$ and holomorphic maps $g:B_2\to B_1$ such that $N \cap (B_1 \times B_2) = \{(g(w) , w)\}$. Note that we can now find a collection of charts of either the first or second kind which cover $N$. In either case, the overlapping map will be the identity on suitable intersection of discs in $\mathbb{C}$. Observe that for the overlapping map between charts of the first and second kind will be the composite $z \longrightarrow (z, \phi(z)) \longrightarrow \phi(z)$. This is just the holomorphic map $\phi$. In each case, the map is holomorphic. Hence $N$ has a complex structure which implies $N$ is a Riemann surface.</p>

		<summary><strong>C1_4:</strong> Let $\sum_g$ be a compact Riemann surface with genus $g$. Prove that there exists no non-constant holomorphic map from $\sum_0$ to $\sum_g$, where $g \geq 1$. <br><br></summary>
		<p><strong>Solution: </strong>Suppose to the contrary that a nonconstant holomorphic map from the sphere to the $g$-surface exists. Then the Riemann Hurwitz formula gives<br>\[2=2-2(0)=d(2-2g)+R_f\leq d(2-2g)\leq2-2\leq2-2(1)=0\]<br>The contradiction is the result that $2\leq0$. Thus no such map exists.<br>We could also use a different solution involving covering spaces.<br>\[\]<br>Let $f:\Sigma_0\to\Sigma_g$ be a holomorphic map. We shall make use of the fact that $\mathbb{H}$ is the universal covering space for $\Sigma_g$ for all $g\geq2$. The case for $g = 1$ follows a similar argument with $\mathbb{C}$ replacing $\mathbb{H}$. Let $p:\mathbb{H}\to\Sigma_g$ be the universal covering map and consider the lifting criterion. The lift $F$ of $f$, $f=p\circ F$, exists if and only if $im(f_*) \subset im(p_*)$. But, since both $\mathbb{H}$ and $\sum_0$ are both simply connected, their fundamental groups are trivial. Therefore, $im(p_*) = 0 = im(f_*)$ which implies that $F$ exists. Since $f$ is a holomorphic function, one can show that $F$ is in fact holomorphic as well. Since $\sum_0 = S^2$ is a compact Riemann surface, by problem 2, this implies $F$ is constant. Since $f = p \circ F$, $f$ is constant. This proves the result.<br>\[\]</p>

		<summary><strong>C1_5:</strong> Let $X$ be a compact Riemann surface. Prove that if there is a meromorphic function on $X$ having exactly one pole, and that pole has order one, then $X$ is equivalent to the Riemann sphere.<br><br></summary>
		<p><strong>Solution: </strong>Let $f:X\to S^2$ be the given meromorphic function. Since $f$ has only a single pole of order one, we know that the cardinality $|f^{-1}(\infty)| = 1$, and by the degree theorem (degree is constant), $deg(f) = 1$. Therefore for any point $y \in S^2$ there is exactly one point $x \in f^{-1}(y)$. Hence $f$ is a bijective map. Note that $f^{-1}$ is also a continuous map since the image under $f$ of a closed set in $X$ is compact in $S^2$ and hence closed. This implies $f$ is a homeomorphism. By a corollary of the inverse function theorem, this implies $f^{-1}$ is also holomorphic. Hence $X$ is equivalent to $S^2$, by the biholomorphism $f$.</p>

		<summary><strong>C1_6:</strong> Show that the meromorphic functions on the Riemann sphere have the form $\frac{p(z)}{q(z)}$, where $p(z)$ and $q(z)$ are coprime polynomials.<br><br></summary>
		<p><strong>Solution: </strong>Let $f:S^2\to S^2$ be a nonconstant meromorphic function. We can use a Mobius transformation (itself a rational function) to alter $f$ so that $f(\infty)\neq0,\infty$. Moreover the composition of rational functions is rational, so we lose no generality in assuming $f(\infty)$ is a nonzero complex number. The degree is constant on nonconstant holomorphic functions between connected compact Riemann surfaces, let $d$ be the degree of $f$. Then there are $d$ roots $z_1,\cdots,z_d$ and $d$ poles $p_1,\cdots,p_d$ of $f$ counting multiplicity. Define $\tilde f$ so that<br>\[f(z)=\prod_{i=1}^d\frac{z-z_i}{z-p_i}\tilde f(z)\]<br>That is, $\tilde f$ is $f$ with its zeroes and poles factored out. Each factor $\frac{z-z_i}{z-p_i}$ approaches 1 as $z\to\infty$, and $f(\infty)$ is some complex number, so $\lim_{z\to\infty}\tilde f(z)$ is some nonzero complex number. Then $\tilde f$ is a bounded entire function, so by Liouville's theorem $\tilde f$ is constant. This makes $f$ a rational function.</p>

		<summary><strong>C2_1:</strong> Prove that a (nonconstant) meromorphic function assumes every value the same number of times (counting multiplicity) on a compact Riemann surface $M$.<br><br></summary>
		<p><strong>Solution: </strong>Let $f:M\to S^2$ be a nonconstant meromorphic function. Because $M$ is compact and $S^2$ is connected, $f$ is surjective (clopen argument). We can assume without loss of generality that $M$ is connected, if not then this proof applies to each connected component and the result is the same. Because $M$ is connected, the degree of $f$ is constant. That is $|f^{-1}(y)| = m$ for all $y\in f(M)=S^2$. This is precisely the statement that $f$ assumes every value the same number of times.</p>

		<summary><strong>C2_2:</strong> Prove that the sum of residues of a meromorphic one-form $\alpha$ on a compact Riemann surface $M$ is zero.<br><br></summary>
		<p><strong>Solution: </strong>Let $D = \{p_1, p_2, \cdots , p_m \}$ denote the poles of the meromorphic one form $\alpha$. Let $C_j$ denote the boundaries of small discs containing $p_j$ in the the positive (counterclockwise) direction. We want to examine the complement of all these discs. Let $S$ = complement in $X$ of the union of all discs containing the poles $p_1$, $\cdots$, $p_m$. $S$ is a relatively compact region on $M$, that is, the closure of $S$ is compact and $\partial S = \{C_1 , \cdots , \ C_j \}$. Observe that when we restrict $\alpha$ to $S \cup \partial S$, $\alpha$ becomes a holomorphic one form since it has no poles there. Let $\tilde{\alpha} = \alpha |_{S\cup \partial S}$. Then by applying Stokes theorem and Cauchy's residue theorem, we get<br>\[0 = \iint_S d\tilde{\alpha} = \int_{\partial S}\tilde{\alpha} = \sum_{j=1}^m \int_{C_j}\alpha = 2\pi i\sum_{j=1}^m Res_{z=p_j}(\alpha)\]</p>

		<summary><strong>C2_3:</strong> Let $f(z)$ be a meromorphic function on a compact Riemann surface $M$. Prove that the sum of the orders of zeros is equal to the sum of the orders of poles.<br><br></summary>
		<p><strong>Solution: </strong>Let $Z$ denote the sum of orders of zeroes of $f$ and $P$ denote the sum of orders of poles of $f$. Let $k_1, \cdots , k_n$ denote the isolated singularities of $\frac{f'}{f}$. Suppose $(U,\phi)$ is a chart in $M$ and let $\gamma$ be any closed path in $U$ not passing through the zeroes and poles of $f$. First note that $\alpha := \frac{f'}{f}dz$ is a meromorphic one form on the compact Riemann surface $M$. By the previous problem, we know that the sum of residues of $\alpha$ is equal to zero. However, by Cauchys residue theorem and the argument principle, we have<br>\[0=\sum_{i=1}^nRes(\alpha; k_i)n(\gamma;k_i)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\gamma}\alpha=Z-P\]<br>Hence $Z=P$ which is the desired result.</p>

		<summary><strong>C2_4:</strong> Let $\alpha = f(z)dz$ be a non-trivial meromorphic one-form on a compact Riemann surface $M$. Prove that the number of zeroes minus the number of poles of $\alpha$ counted according to multiplicity, is equal to $2g-2$, where $g$ is the genus of $M$.<br><br></summary>
		<p><strong>Solution: </strong>Let $\mathcal{Z}$ denote the number of zeroes of $\alpha$ and $\mathcal{P}$ denote the number of poles of $\alpha$ (counted according to multiplicities).<br>The idea is to modify the meromorphic one form $\alpha$. We can't immediately apply the Hopf principle since $\alpha$ might have poles. We want to create a smooth one form $\tilde{\alpha}$ which has only isolated zeroes. Let $\omega = R(x,y)dx \wedge dy$ be a volume form where $R > 0$, $|\alpha|^2 = \frac{1}{R}$. <br>\[\]<br> Now let $p$ be a pole of $\alpha$. Choose a smooth real valued function $p:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$, such that $p(t) = 1$ for small $t$ and $p(t) = \frac{1}{t}$ for large $t$. This is is essentially a bump function. Let $\tilde{\alpha} = p(|\alpha|^2)\alpha$. This is a smooth 1-form which is globally defined on $M$. Moreover, locally around the pole $p$: <br>\[\tilde{\alpha} = \frac{1}{|\alpha|^2}\alpha = \frac{R}{|f(z)|^2}f(z)dz = \frac{R}{f(z) \overline{f(z)}}f(z)dz =^* R(\overline{\frac{1}{f(z)}})dz\]<br> Note that $\overline{\frac{1}{f(z)}}$ tends to a zero with the same order as the pole. Moreover, the sign of the multiplicity also changes. This can be done for every pole of $\tilde{\alpha}$. Thus by the Hopf principle for this 1 form, we get <br>\[\mathcal{Z} - \mathcal{P} = -\chi(M) = 2g-2\]</p>

		<summary><strong>C2_5:</strong> Compute the de Rham cohomology groups of an oriented compact $2$-manifold.<br><br></summary>

		<summary><strong>C2_6:</strong> Suppose that $\Omega$ is a compact region with a smooth boundary in a Riemann surface $M$ and that $\phi$ is a real-valued function which is positive on $\Omega$ and vanishes on the boundary $\partial \Omega$ of $\Omega$. Show that<br>\[\int_{\partial \Omega} i \partial \phi \geq 0\]<br><br></summary>
		<p><strong>Solution: </strong>First, let us consider $\Omega\subset\mathbb{C}$ and recall the definition of $\partial \phi := \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial z}dz$. A routine calculation shows \begin{align*} i \partial \phi &= i \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial z}dz = \frac{i}{2}(\phi_x - i\phi_y)(dx + idy) = \frac{i}{2}(\phi_xdx + i \phi_xdy - i\phi_ydx + \phi_ydy) \\ &= \frac{1}{2}(i \phi_xdx - \phi_xdy + \phi_ydx + i \phi_ydy) = \frac{1}{2}(i(\phi_xdx + \phi_ydy) - (\phi_xdy - \phi_ydx)) \\ &= \frac{1}{2}(i d\phi - (\phi_xdy - \phi_ydx)) \end{align*} Thus \begin{align*} \int_{\partial \Omega} i \partial \phi &= \frac{i}{2}\int_{\partial \Omega} d\phi -\frac{1}{2}\int_{\partial \Omega} \phi_xdy - \phi_ydx \\ &= 0 -\frac{1}{2}\int_{\partial \Omega} \phi_xdy - \phi_ydx = -\frac{1}{2}\int_{\partial \Omega}<br>abla(\phi) \cdot (dy, -dx) \geq 0. \end{align*} The first integral vanishes since $\phi$ vanishes on the boundary of $\Omega$. Following the hint in Donaldson (pg 81), the second term is the negative of the flux of the gradient of $\phi$ across the boundary of $\Omega$. Since $\phi$ is positive on $\Omega$ and zero on the boundary, we know that the gradient of $\phi$ points inward everywhere or vanishes. Therefore the flux is negative which is where the inequality comes from. <br>For a general Riemann surface, one can generalize this by working with local holomorphic parametrizations of $\phi$ and applying the same argument as above.</p>

		<summary><strong>C3_1:</strong> Prove that a topological $S^2$ admits only one complex structure.<br><br></summary>
		<p><strong>Solution: </strong>Let $X$ be our $S^2$ with some arbitrary complex structure. Let $R$ be the Riemann sphere, i.e. $S^2=\mathbb{C}\cup\{\infty\}$ with the standard charts $(S^2\setminus\{\infty\},z),(S^2\setminus\{0\},\frac{1}{z})$. Take a point $p\in X$. Take a chart $(U_p,\phi_p)$ such that $\phi_p(p) = 0$. Consider $f:U_p\to R$ where $f(z)=\frac{1}{\phi_p(z)}$. Since $\phi_p$ is a holomorphic chart, $f$ is a meromorphic function with only a simple pole at $p$ (note $f$ is not defined on all of $X$, just near $p$).<br>Let $\psi$ be a smooth cutoff function such that $\psi=1$ on a neighborhood around $p$, $0\leq\psi\leq1$ on $U_p$, and $\psi=0$ outside $U_p$. Now we can consider the product $\psi f:X \setminus\{p\}\to R$ as a function. Note that <br>\[\overline{\partial}(\psi f) = \overline{\partial}(\psi)f + \overline{\partial}(f) \psi = \overline{\partial}(\psi)f\]<br> by the product rule and the fact that $f$ is holomorphic on its domain iff $\overline{\partial}(f) = 0$. Let $\alpha = \overline{\partial}(\psi f)=\overline{\partial}(\psi)f$. Since $\psi = 1$ near $p$, we know $\overline{\partial}(\psi) = 0$ near $p$. Thus $\alpha=0$ near $p$, so it can be extended at $p$ to give a (0,1) form defined on all of $X$. <br>\[\]<br> Recall our space $X$ has genus $0$. Therefore the dimension of the Dolbeault cohomology $H_X^{(0,1)}$ is $0$, meaning $H_X^{(0,1)}=0$. That means every $\overline\partial$ closed $(0,1)$ form is $\overline\partial$ exact. In our setting, that means $\alpha=\overline\partial(g)$ for some $(0,0)$ form (smooth function) $g$. <br>\[\]<br> Now we have that $\alpha=\overline\partial(g)$ for a smooth function $g$. Define the function $\phi:X\to R$ by $\phi=\psi f-g$. Then <br>\[\overline\partial(\phi)=\alpha-\overline\partial g=0\]<br> That means $\phi$ is a holomorphic map into $R$, i.e. a meromorphic function. Moreover, any poles of $\phi$ must come entirely from $\psi f$ because $g$ is a bounded smooth function ($g:X\to\mathbb{C}$ and $X$ is compact). That means that $\phi$ has a single pole of order 1, and it is at $p$. Because the degree of any holomorphic map is constant, the degree of $\phi$ as a holomorphic map into $R$ is constantly $1$. Thus $\phi$ is actually a bijection, meaning $\phi$ is a biholomorphism from $X$ to $R$.</p>

		<summary><strong>C3_2:</strong> Prove that the Dolbeault cohomology group $H_X^{\;1,1}$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{C}$, where $X$ is a compact Riemann surface.<br><br></summary>
		<p><strong>Solution: </strong>First consider the evaluation map $ev:H_X^{\;1,1}\to\mathbb{C}$ given by $ev(\rho) = \int_X \rho$. We claim that this gives an isomorphism of vector spaces between $H_X^{\;1,1}$ and $\mathbb{C}$. To show $ev$ is well defined, suppose $[\rho] = [\tau]$. Then $\rho-\tau\in im\left(\overline{\partial}\right)$ by the way $H_X^{\;1,1}$ is defined. Let $\rho - \tau = \overline{\partial}f(z)dz$, this is possible because $\rho-\tau\in im\left(\overline{\partial}\right)$. By using Stokes theorem along with the fact $\partial f(z)dz = \frac{\partial f}{\partial z}dz \wedge dz = 0$, we have<br>\[ev(\rho - \tau) = \int_X \overline{\partial}f(z)dz = \int_X dfdz = \int_{\partial X}f(z)dz = \int_{\emptyset}f(z)dz = 0\]<br>Hence the evaluation map is well defined. Also $ev$ is a linear map since integration is linear. <br> To show that $ev$ is surjective, recall (if you happen to have seen it before) that any orientable manifold admits a nowhere-vanishing volume form. Since $X$ is orientable, and volume forms for Riemann surfaces are $(1,1)$ forms (think $dz\wedge d\overline z$), let $\rho$ be a nowhere-vanishing volume form. Then $ev(\rho)\neq0$. We can rescale the integral by considering $a\rho$ for $a\in\mathbb{C}$ if need be to get any $c\in\mathbb{C}$, so $ev$ is surjective. <br>\[\]<br> Now assume $ev(\rho) = 0$. We want to show $\rho \in im(\overline{\partial})$ so that $\rho = [0]$ in the cohomology class. Consider the equation given by $\overline{\partial}\partial f = \rho$. A fundamental PDE result says the existence of a solution to this equation happens iff $ev(\rho) = 0$. By assumption, we can find $\alpha = \partial f$ such that $\overline{\partial}\alpha = \rho$. Thus $\rho \in im(\overline{\partial})$, hence $\rho = [0]$. Thus the map is injective. Thus the spaces are isomorphic.</p>

		<summary><strong>C3_3:</strong> Let $\{x_1, \cdots, x_n\}$ be distinct points on a compact Riemann surface $\Sigma$ and let $\{w_1, \cdots, w_n\}$ be distinct points in $\mathbb{C}$. Show that there is a meromorphic function on $\Sigma$ which maps $x_i$ to $w_i$ for all $i = 1, \cdots, n$.<br><br></summary>
		<p><strong>Solution: </strong>Given $n$ distinct points on $\Sigma$, we want to find a meromorphic function $\phi_1$ such that it has zeroes at all $x_i, i=2, \cdots, n$ and a pole at $x_1$. We are going to do this with the Riemann Roch formula. Consider the divisor $(m\geq0)$<br>\[D=mx_1-x_2-x_3-\cdots-x_n\]<br>Then if a meromorphic function $f$ has $-(f)\leq D$ it must be that $x_i$ is a zero of $f$ with order $\geq1$ for all $2\leq i\leq n$, and if $f$ has a pole it must be at $x_1$ and nowhere else. Moreover this pole will have order $\leq m$, but we don't actually need that for this problem. Now the Riemann Roch formula (skipped straight to the inequality) gives us <br>\[l(D)\geq\|D\|-g+1\]<br> We can compute $\|D\|$, it is $m-n+1$. Thus <br>\[l(D)\geq m-n-g+2\]<br> If $m\geq n+g-1$, then we have <br>\[l(D)\geq1\]<br> Thus the Riemann Roch formula applied to $D=(n+g-1)x_1-x_2-\cdots-x_n$ gives us that $l(D)\geq1$. Let $\phi_1\in L(D)$ be nonzero. Then $\phi_1$ is a meromorphic function on $M$ which takes $x_i$ to $0$ for all $2\leq i\leq n$. Because the degree of $\phi_1$ is constant, $\phi_1$ must also have poles. However the only option for a pole of $\phi_1$ is at $x_1$, so $\phi_1$ must have a pole at $x_1$ so $\phi_1$ is the function we claimed exists. <br> Consider $\psi_1 = \frac {\phi_1(z)}{\phi_1(z)+1}$. Then $\psi_1$ is a meromorphic function such that it takes the value 1 at $x_1$ and zero at the other points. Repeat this process for all the other points $x_2, \cdots , x_n$ to get $\psi_2 \cdots , \psi_n$. By letting $\psi(z) = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i\psi_i(z)$, we get a meromorphic function which sends $x_i$ to $w_i$ for each $i$.</p>

		<summary><strong>C3_4:</strong> Let $M_g$ be a compact Riemann surface of genus $g$. Suppose $f:M_g\to S^2$ is a branched cover. Prove that $R_f = 2(g + r - 1)$, where $R_f$ is the total ramification index of $f$, and $r$ is the number of sheets of the cover.<br><br></summary>
		<p><strong>Solution: </strong>Since $M_g$ and $S^2$ are compact Riemann surfaces and $f$ is holomorphic map, the Riemann Hurwitz formula gives us a way of relating the Ramification index $R_f$ and the Euler characteristic of each surface. Note that the degree of the map $f$ corresponds to the number of sheets of the cover, so $deg(f) = r$. The formula gives us \begin{align*} 2-2g_{M_g} = r(2-2g_{S^2}) - R_f \\ 2-2g = r(2-0) - R_f \\ R_f =2(r + g - 1) \end{align*} Thus the result is shown.</p>

		<p><strong>Solution: </strong>Choose a point $p \in X$ and let $A = \overline{\partial}\left(\frac{\beta}{z}\right) $ where $\beta$ is a smooth cut off function. So $A$ is a $(0,1)$ form defined globally on $X$ which is supported in an annulus around $p$. Define $\rho = \partial A$. First note that since $\overline{\partial}$ is a differential, we have $\overline{\partial}A = \overline{\partial}\; \overline{\partial}\left(\frac{\beta}{z}\right) = 0$. Thus by using Stokes theorem along with the fact that $A$ is compactly supported, we have <br>\[\iint_X \rho = \iint_X \partial A = \iint_X \partial A + \overline{\partial}A = \iint_X (\partial + \overline{\partial})A = \iint_X dA = \int_{\partial X} A = 0.\]<br> By the fundamental PDE result applied to the real and imaginary parts of $\rho$, we can find a complex-valued function $g$ with $\partial \overline{\partial} g = \rho$ and with the real and imaginary parts of $g$ tending to $0$ at infinity of $X$. Define $\alpha$ to be the real 1-form <br>\[\alpha = (A - \overline{\partial}g) + (\overline{A} - \overline{\overline{\partial}g}).\]<br> Note that $\overline{\overline{\partial}g}$ is a $(1,0)$ form so $\partial \overline{\overline{\partial}g}=0$. Hence by using the result, we have <br>\[d\alpha = (\partial + \overline{\partial})(A - \overline{\partial}g) + (\overline{A} - \overline{\overline{\partial}g}) = \partial A - \partial \overline{\partial}g + \overline{\partial}A - \overline{\partial}\; \overline{\partial}g + \partial \overline{A} - \partial \overline{\overline{\partial}g} + \overline{\partial}\; \overline{A} - \overline{\partial}\; \overline{\overline{\partial}g}\]<br> <br>\[\rho - \rho + 0 - 0 + 0 + 0 - 0 + \overline{\rho} - \overline{\rho} = 0\]<br> Since $X$ is simply connected by assumption, $H_{dR}^1(X,\mathbb{R}) = 0$. By this and the calculation that $d\alpha = 0$, we can find a real valued function $\psi$ with $\alpha = d\psi$. This means that $A = \overline{\partial} g + \overline{\partial} \psi$ by another calculation. Hence \begin{align*} \overline{\partial}(\frac{\beta}{z} - (g+\psi)) = 0 \end{align*} on $X \setminus \{ p\}$. Hence $f = \frac{\beta}{z} -( g + \psi)$ is a meromorphic function on $X$ with a simple pole at $p$, and the imaginary part of $f$ tends to zero at infinity on $X \setminus D$, where $D$ is an open disc about $p$, since $\psi$ is real valued.

		<summary><strong>C4_1:</strong> Let $X$ be a complex torus. Prove that there exists a two-sheeted cover $f:X\to S^2$ with four branch points.<br><br></summary>
		<p><strong>Solution: </strong>First, note that any nonconstant map into $S^2$ is a branched cover. This is a result of the fact that the degree of a holomorphic function on compact Riemann surfaces is constant. Moreover, a nonconstant map into $S^2$ is the same thing as a nonconstant meromorphic function. Then we are looking for a meromorphic function with degree 2. The way we will measure the degree is by looking at the poles; we are looking for a meromorphic function $f:X\to S^2$ with two poles (counting multiplicities). We will use the Riemann Roch theorem to obtain such a function, then the Riemann Hurwitz formula to show the result we want.<br>Let $p,q$ be distinct points in $X$. Apply the Riemann Roch theorem to the divisor $D=p+q$ to get <br>\[l(D)-l(K-D)=deg(D)-g+1\]<br> The degree of $D$ is $2$ and the genus is $1$, so $l(D)\geq2$. That means there are two linearly independent meromorphic functions $f_1,f_2$ on $X$ with at worst simple poles at $p$ or $q$. Neither function can have only one pole of order 1 because a meromorphic function of degree 1 is a biholomorphism to $S^2$, and $X<br>ot\cong S^2$. Thus $f_1,f_2$ have either no poles or two poles. A meromorphic function with no poles is constant, and any two constant functions are linearly dependent, so one of them has poles. Then the one with poles has two poles, so we have found a meromorphic function with two poles. <br>\[\]<br> Now apply the Riemann Hurwitz formula to the function $f$ with two poles. <br>\[2-2g_X=d(2-2g_{S^2})-R_f\]<br> <br>\[0=4-R_f\]<br> Thus $R_f=4$. Recall the ramification index is the sum over all points in $X$ of $(p-1)$ where $f$ is given as $z^p$ in particular coordinates centered at $x$ (local mapping theorem). The degree of $f$ is $2$, so the highest $p$ can possibly be is $2$. That means the ramification index must come from four distinct points, each of which is a two-fold branch. Thus $f$ is a two-sheeted cover with four branch points.</p>

		<p><strong>Solution: </strong>Let $D = \{p_1,\cdots,p_d\}$ be $d$ distinct points in $X$. Then there exists a meromorphic function $f$ with residues at some subset of $\{T_1,\cdots,T_d\}$ if and only if for all $\theta \in H_X^{(1,0)}$, we have<br>\[\sum_{i=1}^d\langle T_i,\theta(p_i)\rangle=0\]<br>\[\implies\]<br> Assume there exists a meromorphic function $f$ with residues at some subset of $\{T_1,\cdots,T_d\}$. Let $\theta$ be a holomorphic one form on $X$. Observe that $f\theta$ is a meromorphic one form on a compact Riemann surface. Thus by a previous homework problem (homework 2 problem 2), we know the sum of residues of $f\theta$ is equal to 0. This is precisely the desired result. <br>\[\impliedby\]<br> Assume that for any holomorphic one form $\theta$, we have $\sum_{i=1}^d\langle T_i,\theta(p_i)\rangle=0$. Consider the $\overline{\partial}$ construction: <br>\[\sum_{i=1}^d\lambda_i\overline{\partial}\frac{\beta_i}{z-p_i}=[b]\in H_X^{(0,1)}\]<br> Note that $\langle b,\theta\rangle$ is definite and by our assumption, we know for any $\theta$, $\langle b,\theta\rangle=0$. Therefore $[b]=0$. This means $b=\overline{\partial}f$. By solving the $\overline{\partial}$ equation like before, we can find a meromorphic function with poles at each point in $D$.</p>

		<summary><strong>C4_4:</strong> Prove that there exists no non-constant holomorphic map from $\mathbb{C}$ to $\Sigma_g$ for $g\geq2$.<br><br></summary>
		<p><strong>Solution: </strong>First recall that the universal cover of $\Sigma_g$ for $g \geq 2$ is the half-plane. This means we have a holomorphic (locally biholomorphic) covering map $p:\mathbb{H}\to\Sigma_g$. Suppose we have a holomorphic map $f:\mathbb{C}\to\Sigma_g$. Then, since $\mathbb{C}$ is simply connected, by the topological map lifting lemma we have a continuous function $F$ such that $f=p\circ F$. Since $p$ is locally biholomorphic, this means that $F=p^{-1}\circ f$ locally, and thus $F$ is holomorphic. Therefore we have a holomorphic function $F:\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{H}$.<br>(this proof is much clearer with a diagram but I can't draw those here yet) <br>\[\]<br> By the Riemann mapping theorem, there exist a biholomorphism $g:\mathbb{H}\to D$, the unit disk (this is also a simple Mobius transformation but why not use the Riemann mapping theorem since we can?). Thus $g\circ F$ is a holomorphic function from $\mathbb{C}$ to $D$. In other words, $|g\circ F(z)|<1$ for all $z\in\mathbb{C}$ and is thus a bounded entire function. Thus $g\circ F$ is constant by Liouville\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s theorem. We know that $g$ is already a biholomorphism, so $F$ is constant. That means $f$ is constant as well.</p>

Suppose $\mathcal{F}$ is normal and let $z_0$ be an element of $\Omega$. Then the result of Arzela-Ascoli theorem holds. Let $M$ be such that $|f(z_0)|\leq M$ for all $f$, this is result 1) of AA. By result 2), there is a $\delta>0$ such that $|f(z)-f(z_0)|< M+\epsilon$ for all $f\in\mathcal{F}$ and for all $z\in B_{\delta}(z_0)$. This shows that $\mathcal{F}$ is locally bounded at $z_0$, with the constants $M+\epsilon$ and $\delta$.<br>Now suppose that $\mathcal{F}$ is locally bounded at all points in $\Omega$. This assumption immediately shows part 1) of AA, because bounded subsets of $\mathbb{C}$ are relatively compact. We need to show $\mathcal{F}$ is equicontinuous at $z_0$. Take the constants $M,r$ from the definition of locally bounded, also choose $r$ small enough so that $\overline{B_r(z_0)}\subset\Omega$. Then for all $z\in B_r(z_0)$ and all $f\in\mathcal{F}$, we have asusmed that $|f(z)|\leq M$.<br>Let $\epsilon>0$ be given. Let $z\in\Omega$ with $|z-z_0|<\frac{r}{2}$. Let $\gamma$ be the circle $|z-z_0|=r$. By Cauchy's integral formula applied to arbitrary $f\in\mathcal{F}$,\[|f(z)-f(z_0)|=\left|\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_\gamma\frac{f(w)}{w-z}dw-\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_\gamma\frac{f(w)}{w-z_0}dw\right|=\frac{1}{2\pi}\left|\int_\gamma\frac{f(w)(z-z_0)}{(w-z)(w-z_0)}dw\right|\]<br>\[\leq\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_\gamma\left|\frac{f(w)(z-z_0)}{(w-z)(w-z_0)}\right||dw|.\]<br>Here we will use some bounds. $|f(w)|\leq M$, $|w-z_0|=r$, and $|w-z|\geq\frac{r}{2}$. Thus<br>\[\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_\gamma\left|f(w)(z-z_0)\frac{1}{w-z}\frac{1}{w-z_0}\right||dw|\leq\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_\gamma M|z-z_0|\frac{2}{r}\frac{1}{r}|dw|=\frac{M}{\pi r^2}|z-z_0|\int_\gamma|dw|=\frac{2M}{r}|z-z_0|<\frac{3M}{r}|z-z_0|.\]<br>Therefore if we choose $\delta$ to be $0<\delta<\frac{r\epsilon}{2}$ (so this whole argument applies) and less than $\frac{r}{3M}$, then we have shown equicontinuous and therefore (by AA) normal.</p>

		<p><strong>Solution: </strong>Define an antiderivative for $f$ inspired by the fundamental theorem of calculus. Fix a point $z_0\in\Omega$ and for any $w\in\Omega$ define $F(w)=\int_{p_w}f(z)dz$ where $p_w$ is a path starting at $z_0$ and ending at $w$. The definition of $F$ is independent of path because of the closed curve assumption. Then show that $F$ is an antiderivative of $f$. Do this directly with difference quotient, using the fact that $f$ is continuous.<br>\[\lim_{w\to z_0}\frac{F(w)-F(z_0)}{w-z_0}=\lim_{w\to z_0}\frac{1}{w-z_0}\int_{p_w}f(z)dz.\]<br>If $w$ is near enough to $z_0$, then $p_w$ can be taken to be the straight line $tw+(1-t)z_0$ for $0\leq t\leq1$.<br>\[=\lim_{w\to z_0}\frac{1}{w-z_0}\int_0^1f(tw+(1-t)z_0)(w-z_0)dt=\lim_{w\to z_0}\int_0^1f(tw+(1-t)z_0)dt.\]<br>If $w$ is close to $z_0$, then $f(tw+(1-t)z_0)$ will be close to $f(z_0)$.<br>\[\sim\lim_{w\to z_0}\int_0^1f(z_0)dt=f(z_0).\]<br>Thus the difference quotient of $F$ gives that $F'=f$. That, in particular, shows that $F$ is holomorphic. Derivatives of holomorphic functions are holomorphic, so $f$ is also holomorphic.<br>This theorem is proven by constructing a global antiderivative. We never used the fact that the antiderivative is global, however, so we can do the same construction to obtain a local antiderivative under the weaker assumption that we only force $\int_\gamma f(z)dz=0$ for closed curves $\gamma$ which only encircle points in $\Omega$, which is weaker because there are fewer of these than there are of all closed paths. This applies to non-simply-connected domains, as well. The only difference is that the antiderivative $F$ will only be locally defined.</p>

Moreover, if $a\in\Omega$ there is a unique biholomorphism $f:\Omega\to D$ such that $f(a)=0$ and $f'(a)>0$<br><br></summary>
		<p><strong>Solution: </strong>Uniqueness comes from the Schwarz lemma. Suppose $f,g$ are both biholomorphisms from $\Omega$ to the disc with $f(a)=g(a)=0$ and $f'(a)>0, g'(a)>0$. Then $H=f\circ g^{-1}$ and $H^{-1}=g\circ f^{-1}$ are automorphisms of the disc which fix 0, so by the Scharz lemma<br>\[|H(z)|\leq|z|=|H^{-1}(H(z))|\leq|H(z)|\]<br>Therefore the inequalities are equalities and by Schwarz lemma $H=\lambda\cdot\text{id}$, or $(f\circ g^{-1})(z)=\lambda z$, where $|\lambda|=1$. Taking the derivative of both sides at $z=0$ gives\[\frac{f'(a)}{g'(a)}=\lambda\]Because both $f'(a)$ and $g'(a)$ are positive real numbers, $\lambda$ must be a positive real number as well. Also we know $|\lambda|=1$, so $\lambda=1$ making $f\circ g^{-1}=\text{id}$. That shows $f=g$.\[\]Now to show that the Riemann map exists. We first need to show there exists a nonconstant bounded holomorphic function $f$ on $\Omega$. From there we can do some analysis to construct the biholomorphism. We are going to perform a series of injective holomorphic transformations to our region $\Omega$. First, we assumed that $\Omega$ is not the whole plane so let $z_0<br>otin\mathbb{C}$. Then define $\Omega_1$ to be the image of $\Omega$ under the map $z-z_0$. Then $\Omega_1$ is a simply connected region which does not contain 0 and is biholomorphic to $\Omega$.\[\]Now we are going to define a branch of log on $\Omega_1$. Fix a point $l\in\Omega_1$ and for any $z\in\Omega_1$ let $p_z$ be a path in $\Omega_1$ starting at $l$ and ending at $z$. Define \[\ln(z)=\int_{p_z}\frac{1}{z}dz\]First we need to check this is well-defined. Suppose $p_z,p'_z$ are two paths from $l$ to $z$. Then $p_z-p'_z$ is a loop in $\Omega_1$. Because $\Omega_1$ is simply connected, this loop is contractible. Then by Cauchy's integral theorem (homotopy version),\[\int_{p_z}\frac{1}{z}dz-\int_{p'_z}\frac{1}{z}dz=\int_{p_z-p'_z}\frac{1}{z}dz=\int_l\frac{1}{z}dz=0\]Thus our function $\ln$ is well-defined. As to why it is a branch of log, by construction $\ln'(z)=\frac{1}{z}$ and $\ln(l)=0$. For fun we will now show that any antiderivative of $\frac{1}{z}$ with a certain initial condition satisfied by our $\ln$ must be a branch of log.\[\]Suppose $f$ is a function defined on a region in $\mathbb{C}^*$ with $f'(z)=\frac{1}{z}$ and suppose there is some $a$ in our region and some integer $k$ for which $f(a)=2k\pi i$. Then\[\left(e^f\right)'(z)=\frac{e^{f(z)}}{z}\]Thus $e^f$ is a solution to the differential equation $f'(z)=\frac{1}{z}f(z)$. The solution space to this equation is one dimensional (first order equation) and is spanned by the identity function, so $e^f=\lambda\text{id}$. To solve for $\lambda$, plug in $a$ to get $\lambda a=e^{f(a)}=e^{2k\pi i}=1$. Thus $e^f=\text{id}$, so $f$ is a branch of log.\[\]Now we have constructed a branch of log on $\Omega_1$. Note that branches of log are injective because by definition a branch of log is a section of the exponential map and sections must be injective (section means right inverse). Define the map $\sqrt z$ on $\Omega_1$ by $\sqrt{z}=e^{\frac{1}{2}\ln(z)}$. Note $\left(e^{\frac{1}{2}\ln(z)}\right)^2=e^{\ln(z)}=z$. The property we are interested in for $\sqrt z$ is called $\pm$ injectivity. Suppose that $a,b$ are in $\Omega_1$ and $\sqrt a=\pm\sqrt b$. Squaring both sides gives that $a=b$. Note that $\pm$ injectivity implies, in particular, injectivity. Define $\Omega_2$ to be the image of $\Omega_1$ under $\sqrt z$.\[\]Now we have a region $\Omega_2$ which is biholomorphic to $\Omega$. Moreover, being the image of a region under the exponential map, $0<br>otin\Omega_2$. We will show $\Omega_2$ is actually missing an entire neighborhood of $\mathbb{C}$. Choose any point $c\in\Omega_2$ and any ball $B$ centered at $c$ with $B\subset\Omega_2$. Such a ball exists because $\Omega$ was open and biholomorphisms are open maps, so $\Omega_2$ is open. Define $-B=\{z|-z\in B\}$. We will show $-B\cap\Omega_2=\emptyset$. Suppose $w\in-B$. Then $-w\in B\subset\Omega_2$, so $-w=\sqrt z$ for some $z\in\Omega_1$, or $w=-\sqrt{z}$. If there were some $z'\in\Omega_1$ with $w=\sqrt{z'}$ then $\sqrt{z'}=-\sqrt z$, which by $\pm$ injectivity means $z=z'$, meaning $w=-w=0$. However, $0<br>otin\Omega_2$. Thus $-B\cap\Omega_2=\emptyset$.\[\]Define $\Omega_3$ to be the image of $\Omega_2$ under the biholomorphism $z-(-c)=z+c$. This biholomorphism puts the center of $-B$ at the origin. Let $r$ be the radius of $B$. Then for all $z\in\Omega_3, |z|>r$.\[\]Define $\Omega_4$ to be the image of $\Omega_3$ under the injective holomorphism $\frac{1}{z}$. Then for all $z\in\Omega_4, z=\frac{1}{y}$ for some $y\in\Omega_3$. Being in $\Omega_3, |y|>r$. Thus $|z|<\frac{1}{r}$. That is, $\Omega_4$ is a bounded domain which is biholomorphic to $\Omega$.\[\]From here we can use translations, rotations, and scaling to obtain an injective holomorphism from $\Omega$ into the unit disc which sends $a$ to $0$ with positive derivative. If we consider the set of all such functions, we can do a supremum argument on the value of the derivative at $a$ to obtain a sequence of functions. We can show this sequence converges to the Riemann map we are looking for. This part of the proof is never on the qual so we won't go into it here.</p>

Elements of $\langle M\rangle$ are called divisors. The divisor $(f)\in\langle M\rangle$ associated to $f$ is defined to be \[(f)=\sum_{p\in M}f_pp\] Given any divisor $D$, $D$ takes the form \[D=\sum_{p\in M}d_pp\] where $d_p\in\mathbb{Z}$ and all but finitely many $d_p$ are $0$. We define \[\|D\|=\sum_{p\in M}d_p\] Given two divisors $D,D'$, we say $D\leq D'$ if $d_p\leq d'_p$ for all $p\in M$. Given two meromorphic functions $f,g$ on $M$, we have that $(f)\leq(g)$ if every zero of $f$ is also a zero of $g$ of at least as high a degree, and every pole of $g$ is also a pole of $f$ of at least as high a degree. Also, $-(f)=\left(\frac{1}{f}\right)$ because negating the divisor corresponds to swapping zeroes and poles, which is what inverting the function does as well.\[\]Given a divisor $D\geq0$, we want to define the quantity $l(D)$. First, consider the set $L(D)$ where elements of $L(D)$ are meromorphic functions $f$ on $M$ such that $-(f)\leq D$. This condition is a bound on how bad the poles at $f$ can be. Then $L(D)$ is a vector space over $\mathbb{C}$, because adding meromorphic functions and scaling cannot move poles and cannot introduce more poles. Then we define $l(D)$ to be the dimension of $L(D)$. We also want to mention that $l(K-D)$ represents the dimension of the vector space of holomorphic one-forms which must vanish at any point $p$ where $d_p>0$, though we don't care so much about the details of this part.\[\]We are finally ready to state the Riemann Roch theorem. Suppose $D$ is a divisor on $M$ where $M$ has genus $g$. Then \[l(D)-l(K-D)=\|D\|-g+1\] In particular, $l(K-D)\geq0$ so \[l(D)\geq\|D\|-g+1\]\[\]Note that I have been using $\|D\|$ to mean what is commonly referred to as degree of $D$, or $deg(D)$.

		<p><strong>Solution: </strong>The number of zeroes $Z$ of $g$ is given by the argument principle,<br>\[\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{g\circ\gamma}\frac{1}{z}dz.\]<br>That is, the number of zeroes of $g$ inside $\gamma$ is the number of times the image of $\gamma$ under $g$ winds around $0$. We are going to show that this number is the same for $g$ as it is for $f+g$.<br>By our assumption, $|f(z)|<|g(z)|$ for all $z\in\gamma$. Take the straight line $tg(z)+(1-t)(f(z)+g(z))$ connecting $g(z)$ to $f(z)+g(z)$ for $0\leq t\leq1$. We will show this line does not pass through 0. For simpler notations, let $a=f(z)$ and $b=g(z)$. Then $|a|<|b|$ and we are claiming that $tb+(1-t)(a+b)\neq0$ for all $0\leq t\leq 1$. By assumption, $g(z)\neq0$ because $|g(z)|$ must be in particular strictly positive. Thus our claim holds for $t=1$. If $t\neq1$ (so that $1-t>0$),<br>\[|tb+(1-t)(a+b)|=|(1-t)a+b|=|b-(1-t)(-a)|\] \[\geq|b|-(1-t)|-a|=|b|-(1-t)|a|>|b|-(1-t)|b|=t|b|\geq0.\]<br>The second-to-last inequality is strict (by assumption and the fact that $1-t>0$), so overall this is a strict inequality, meaning the term we are interested in cannot be 0 because its norm is strictly positive.<br>Now that we have shown the straight line from $g(z)$ to $f(z)+g(z)$ does not pass through $0$ for any $z\in\gamma$, we consider the pointwise straight-line-homotopy between the curves $g\circ\gamma$ and $(f+g)\circ\gamma$. We have shown this homotopy never hits $0$, so it is a path homotopy in $\mathbb{C}\setminus\{0\}$ which is the domain on which $\frac{1}{z}$ is holomorphic. Thus by Cauchy's integral theorem (path homotopy version), the integrals below are the same.<br>\[\int_{g\circ\gamma}\frac{1}{z}dz=\int_{(f+g)\circ\gamma}\frac{1}{z}dz.\]<br>Then by the argument principle, the number of zeroes of $g$ and $f+g$ are the same.</p>

		<p><strong>Solution: </strong>If $\Omega$ is a simply connected region, then either $\Omega=\mathbb{C}$ or not. In the first case, affine linear maps provide enough automorphisms of $\Omega$ to prove the result. Concretely, $\phi_{x,y}^\lambda(z)=\lambda(z-x)+y$. If $\Omega\neq\mathbb{C}$ then $\Omega$ is biholomorphic to $\mathbb{D}$ by the Riemann mapping theorem. Mobius transformations combined with rotations provide enough automorphisms of the disc to conclude that the automorphism group of the disc is spin-transitive, and this property is preserved under biholomorphism. We can fix a biholomorphism from $\Omega$ to $\mathbb{D}$, trace out the desired behavior in $\mathbb{D}$, obtain that behavior with an automorphism of the disc, and then pull it back to $\Omega$ via the biholomorphism. We omit the details at present.<br>For the annulus, the automorphism group is much smaller. We presume that we know any automorphism of $A$ extends continuously to the boundary (I'm still not quite sure how this works, see Kellogg's theorem), whence it must take the boundary to the boundary. Moreover it either exchanges the two circles or not. If the circles were exchanged we can compose with $\frac{1}{2z}$ to unexchange the circles, so we investigate now all automorphisms of $A$ which do not exchange the boundary circles.<br>Suppose $\phi:A\to A$ is an automorphism which does not exchange the two boundary circles. Then the function $\frac{\phi(z)}{z}:A\to\mathbb{C}$ is holomorphic. Moreover, for all $z\in\partial A$,<br>\[\left|\frac{\phi(z)}{z}\right|=\frac{|\phi(z)|}{|z|}=1\]<br>precisely because the circles are not exchanged. By the maximum principle applied to the real and imaginary parts of $\frac{\phi(z)}{z}$, this function must be constant because it is constant on the boundary. Thus $\phi(z)=\lambda z$ with $|\lambda|=1$, so $\phi$ is just a rotation.<br>We conclude by recognizing that we have shown any automorphism of $A$ is either a rotation or $\frac{1}{2z}$ followed by a rotation. This is too restrictive for the automorphism group to be transitive, we can see this because any automorphism fixes the circle $|z|=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$. Clearly rotations fix this circle, and $\frac{1}{2z}$ fixes this circle as well. Thus $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$ can never be sent to $\frac{3}{2}$ via an automorphism of $A$, so the automorphism group is not transitive.</p>

		<p><strong>Solution: </strong>First we take the derivative of the assumed equation to get<br>\[f'(z)=e^{g(z)}g'(z)=f(z)g'(z).\]<br>That is, if $g$ exists then $g'=\frac{f'}{f}$.

Therefore by Cauchy's integral theorem, for any loop $\gamma$ in $\mathbb{C}$,<br>\[\int_\gamma\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}dz=0\]<br>(We could also use the argument principle here -- the above integral is $2\pi i(Z-P)$ where $Z,P$ are the zeroes and poles of $f$, of which there are none).<br>From here we copy the proof of Morera's theorem. Let $a\in\mathbb{C}$ and choose a path $p_a$ from $0$ to $a$. Define<br>\[g(a)=\int_{p_a}\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}dz.\]<br>This definition is path independent by the above vanishing integral.

Then<br>\[\lim_{h\to0}\frac{g(a+h)-g(a)}{h}=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{1}{h}\left(\int_{p_a+p_a^{a+h}}\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}dz-\int_{p_a}\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}dz\right)=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{1}{h}\int_{p_a^{a+h}}\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}dz\]<br>\[=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{1}{h}\int_0^1\frac{f'(a+th)}{f(a+th)}hdt=\lim_{h\to0}\int_0^1\frac{f'(a+th)}{f(a+th)}dt.\]<br>Convergence is uniform on compact sets, so limits come in and we get<br>\[=\int_0^1\frac{f'(a)}{f(a)}dt=\frac{f'(a)}{f(a)}.\]<br>Thus $g$ is holomorphic with derivative $\frac{f'}{f}$. Now we show this does what we want by showing $\frac{f}{e^g}$ is constant.<br>\[\left(\frac{f}{e^g}\right)'=\frac{f'e^g-f\left(e^g\right)'}{e^{2g}}.\]<br>The numerator is<br>\[f'e^g-f\left(e^g\right)'=f'e^g-fe^gg'=f'e^g-fe^g\frac{f'}{f}=0.\]<br>Thus $\frac{f}{e^g}$ is constant, so $f=\alpha e^g$ for some constant $\alpha$. We know $\alpha\neq0$, so take some $\beta$ such that $e^\beta=\alpha$. This is possible in the scope of this problem because $\alpha$ is just a number. Then $f=e^\beta e^g=e^{\beta+g}$.<br>The second part is just applying the result to the nonvanishing holomorphic function $z:\Omega\to\mathbb{C}$.

		<p><strong>Solution: </strong>a) Suppose $\Omega$ is a region in $\mathbb{C}$ and that there is some $a\in\mathbb{C}, r>0$ such that $B_r(a)\cap\Omega=B_r(a)\setminus\{a\}$.

		<p><strong>Solution: </strong>We know that, as an analytic function which takes $a$ to 0, $f(z)=(z-a)^kr(z)$ where $k\geq1$ and $r$ is analytic. Moreover, $k$ must be 1 and $r(a)\neq0$ because $f'(a)\neq0$, so $f(z)=(z-a)r(z)$. Likewise $g(z)=(z-a)s(z)$ for some analytic $s$ with $s(a)\neq0$. Then<br>\[\lim_{z\to a}\frac{f(z)}{g(z)}=\lim_{z\to a}\frac{(z-a)r(z)}{(z-a)s(z)}=\lim_{z\to a}\frac{r(z)}{s(z)}=\frac{r(a)}{s(a)}.\]<br>Also $f'(z)=r(z)+(z-a)r'(z)$ and $g'(z)=s(z)+(z-a)s'(z)$, so $f'(a)=r(a), g'(a)=s(a)$, and<br>\[\lim_{z\to a}\frac{f'(z)}{g'(z)}=\lim_{z\to a}\frac{r(z)+(z-a)r'(z)}{s(z)+(z-a)s'(z)}.\]<br>Now $r'$ and $s'$ are analytic so, in particular, are continuous, and $r(a)$ and $s(a)$ are still nonzero, so this limit reduces to $\frac{r(a)}{s(a)}=\frac{f'(a)}{g'(a)}$ also.</p>

		<p><strong>Solution: </strong>We could probably get this to work using Schwarz' lemma, but why not use Cauchy's estimate instead?

		<p><strong>Solution: </strong>There are many ways to do this one; we choose Morera's theorem. Let $a\in G$ and let $\gamma$ be a contractible-in-$G$ loop with winding number $1$ about $a$.

		<summary><strong>f19f6:</strong> Using contour integration (that is, the residue theorem), evaluate<br>\[\int_0^\infty\frac{dx}{1+x^2}.\]<br><br></summary>
		<p><strong>Solution: </strong>First we note that $\frac{1}{1+x^2}$ is an $L^1$ even function, so $\int_0^\infty\frac{1}{1+x^2}dx=\frac{1}{2}\int_{-\infty}^\infty\frac{1}{1+x^2}dx$. Tabling this for now, suppose $R>1$ and let $\gamma_R$ be the rainbow contour in $\mathbb{C}$ given by the straight line $L_R$ from $-R$ to $R$ and the arc $C_R$ from $R$ to $-R$ along the upper half of the circle $|z|=R$, oriented so that $\gamma_R$ has positive orientation. Then<br>\[\lim_{R\to\infty}\int_{\gamma_R}\frac{1}{1+z^2}dz=\lim_{R\to\infty}\int_{L_R}\frac{1}{1+z^2}dz+\lim_{R\to\infty}\int_{C_R}\frac{1}{1+z^2}dz.\]<br>We already know that $\lim_{R\to\infty}\int_{L_R}\frac{1}{1+z^2}dz=\int_{-\infty}^\infty\frac{1}{1+x^2}dx$, we shall show the $C_R$ component vanishes in the limit.<br>\[\left|\int_{C_R}\frac{1}{1+z^2}dz\right|\leq\int_{C_R}\left|\frac{1}{1+z^2}\right||dz|\leq\int_{C_R}\frac{|dz|}{|z^2|-1}=\int_0^\pi\frac{Rdt}{R^2-1}=\frac{\pi R}{R^2-1}\to0.\]<br>Therefore $\int_0^\infty\frac{1}{1+x^2}dx=\frac{1}{2}\lim_{R\to\infty}\int_{\gamma_R}\frac{1}{1+z^2}dz$. Moreover, Cauchy's integral theorem tells us that $\int_{\gamma_R}\frac{1}{1+z^2}dz$ does not depend on $R$ as long as $R>1$, because the only singularities of $\frac{1}{1+z^2}$ occur at $z=\pm i$. Thus $\int_0^\infty\frac{1}{1+x^2}dx=\frac{1}{2}\int_{\gamma_R}\frac{1}{1+z^2}dz$ for any $R>1$.<br>Now $\frac{1}{1+z^2}=\frac{1}{2i}\left(\frac{1}{z-i}-\frac{1}{z+i}\right)$, and the residue theorem tells us that the integral of this function around $\gamma_R$ is $2\pi i\left(\frac{1}{2i}\right)=\pi$ because the only contributing residue is the $\frac{1}{2i}$ coming from the pole at $z=i$. Therefore $\int_0^\infty\frac{1}{1+x^2}dx=\frac{\pi}{2}$.</p>

		<p><strong>Solution: </strong>We can use partial fractions to write $\frac{1}{z(z-1)(z-2)}$ as $\frac{a}{z}+\frac{b}{z-1}+\frac{c}{z-2}$. For completeness we do that here. Cross multiplying gives<br>\[1=a(z-1)(z-2)+bz(z-2)+cz(z-1).\]<br>At $z=0$ we find $a=\frac{1}{2}$, at $z=1$ we find $b=-1$, and at $z=2$ we find $c=\frac{1}{2}$. Thus<br>\[f(z)=\frac{1}{2z}-\frac{1}{z-1}+\frac{1}{2(z-2)}.\]<br>The region in which we are interested is outside all of the poles, so we will be factoring $z$ out of the denominator as much as we can. Thus we are more interested in expressing $f$ as<br>\[f(z)=\frac{1}{2z}-\frac{1}{z(1-\frac{1}{z})}+\frac{1}{2z(1-\frac{2}{z})}.\]<br>Using the geometric series formula on the second term (where $|\frac{1}{z}|<1$ because $|z|>1$) and the third (where $|\frac{2}{z}|<1$ because $|z|>2$), we have<br>\[f(z)=\frac{1}{2z}-\frac{1}{z}\sum_{n=0}^\infty\left(\frac{1}{z}\right)^n+\frac{1}{2z}\sum_{n=0}^\infty\left(\frac{2}{z}\right)^n\]<br>\[=\frac{1}{2}z^{-1}-\sum_{n=0}^\infty z^{-n-1}+\sum_{n=0}^\infty2^{n-1}z^{-n-1}=\frac{1}{2}z^{-1}+\sum_{n=1}^\infty(2^{n-2}-1)z^{-n}.\]</p>

		<p><strong>Solution: </strong>First we rewrite the function $\frac{f(z)}{(z-a)(z-b)}$ as $f(z)(a-b)\left(\frac{1}{z-a}-\frac{1}{z-b}\right)$ to justify evaluating the integral(s)<br>\[\int_\gamma f(z)(z-a)\left(\frac{1}{a-b}-\frac{1}{z-b}\right)dz=(a-b)\left(\int_\gamma\frac{f(z)}{z-a}dz-\int_\gamma\frac{f(z)}{z-b}dz\right).\]<br>By Cauchy's integral formula these yield<br>\[=(a-b)(f(a)-f(b)).\]<br>On the other hand, an estimate gives<br>\[\left|\int_\gamma\frac{f(z)}{(z-a)(z-b)}dz\right|\leq\int_\gamma\frac{|f(z)|}{|z-a||z-b|}|dz|.\]<br>Suppose $f$ is globally bounded by $M$ in modulus.

		<p><strong>Solution: </strong>a) (assuming this is a class which follows Conway) The function $f:U\to\mathbb{C}$ is analytic at a point $a\in U$ if $f$ is $C^1$ as a real-valued function and if<br>\[\lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}\]<br>exists, recalling that this limit is defined with neighborhoods in $\mathbb{C}$.

		<p><strong>Solution: </strong>First we rewrite $f$ as $f(z)=z\overline z$. The difference quotient is<br>\[\lim_{h\to0}\frac{(z+h)\overline{(z+h)}-z\overline z}{h}=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{z\overline h+h\overline z+h\overline h}{h}.\]<br>The $h$ cancels on the last two terms, giving<br>\[=z\left(\lim_{h\to0}\frac{\overline h}{h}\right)+\overline z+\lim_{h\to0}\overline h=z\left(\lim_{h\to0}\frac{(\overline h)}{h}\right)+\overline z.\]<br>As we all know, $\lim_{h\to0}\frac{(\overline h)}{h}$ is ill-defined, we can see this by taking $h=\alpha t$ for $\alpha=1,i$ and taking $t\to 0$. The ill-definedness persists precisely when $z\neq0$; if $z=0$ the problem doesn't matter because the 0 annihilates the numerator. Thus $f$ has a derivative only at $z=0$.</p>

		<p><strong>Solution: </strong>a) This would be an easy application of Cauchy's integral formula but let's use some more elementary methods to show off. We will show the CIF solution afterwards. Take the Maclaurin expansion of $\sin(z)$,<br>\[\sin(z)=z-\frac{z^3}{3!}+\frac{z^5}{5!}-\cdots.\]<br>Define $p_n(z)$ to be the $n^{th}$ partial sum of this expansion. Then $p_n$ is a polynomial for each $n$ and $p_n\to\sin$ uniformly on compact sets. On $\mathbb{C}^*$, the functions $\frac{p_n(z)}{z^3}$ converge uniformly on compact sets to $f(z)=\frac{\sin(z)}{z^3}$.<br>The functions $\frac{p_n(z)}{z^3}$ are the partial sums of the series<br>\[\frac{1}{z^2}-\frac{1}{3!}+\frac{z^5}{5!}-\cdots.\]<br>Each of these functions has no residue at the origin (vanishing $z^{-1}$ term), so by the residue theorem the integral $\int_\gamma\frac{p_n(z)}{z^3}dz=0$ for each $n$. Then, by uniform convergence on $\gamma$,<br>\[\int_\gamma\frac{f(z)}{z^3}dz=\lim_{n\to\infty}\int_\gamma\frac{p_n(z)}{z^3}dz=0.\]<br>b) see solution to f19f1, it is the same question and the techniques are identical to those above.<br>ps: the CIF version of a)<br>By Cauchy's integral formula,<br>\[\int_\gamma\frac{\sin(z)}{z^3}dz=\frac{2\pi i}{2!}\sin^{(2)}(0).\]<br>How can we tell what $\sin^{(2)}(0)$ is? This depends on what we know about $\sin$. We will rely on the properties that $\sin$ is a solution to the ODE $f''(z)+f(z)=0$ and that $\sin$ is odd. Because $\sin$ is a solution to aforementioned ODE, $\sin^{(2)}(0)=-\sin(0)$. Because $\sin$ is odd, $-\sin(0)=\sin(-0)=\sin(0)$. Therefore $\sin(0)=0$, so $\sin^{(2)}(0)=0$, so the integral $\int_\gamma\frac{\sin(z)}{z^3}dz=0$.</p>

Determine the radius of convergence of the power series for $f$ expanded about $a$.<br><br></summary>
		<p><strong>Solution: </strong>a) Recall $\sin(z)=\frac{1}{2i}(e^{iz}-e^{-iz})$, this is the most computationally-convenient definition of complex $\sin$. This vanishes precisely when $e^{iz}=e^{-iz}$, which is equivalent to $e^{2iz}=1$. If $z=x+iy$ then this is also<br>\[e^{-2y}e^{2ix}=1.\]<br>Taking modulus implies $e^{-2y}=1$, so this is only satisfied when $y=0$. Assume $y=0$, we are solving $e^{2ix}=1$. We know that $e^0=1$ and we know $e^z$ is $2\pi i$-periodic in $z$, so this is satisfied precisely when $x=\pi k$ for some integer $k$. Thus $\sin(z)=0$ if and only if $z=\pi k$ for some integer $k$.<br>Substituting $w=-iz^2$ and using our knowledge that $\sin(w)=0$ if and only if $w=2\pi k$ gives that $\sin(-iz^2)=0$ if and only if $-iz^2=2\pi k$, or $z=\pm\sqrt{2\pi ik}$ for $k\in\mathbb{Z}$.<br>b) The radius of convergence will be the largest it can be without surpassing a pole. The closest pole to $a$ is $0$, so the radius of convergence is $a$ itself.</p>

Because $\mathbb{C}$ is simply connected, we can find a harmonic conjugate and extend $u$ to be the real part of an entire function $f$. Because $u$ is bounded, we can translate by a sufficiently large real number so that the real part of $f$ never vanishes.

Suppose further that there is some $a\in\Omega$ such that $f_n(a)=f_k(a)$ for all $n,k$. Show that there is a holomorphic function $f$ from $\Omega$ to the half plane and a subsequence $k$ of $n$ such that $f_k\to f$. Is the same result true if we drop the requirement of $a$?<br><br></summary>
		<p><strong>Solution: </strong>First fix the biholomorphism<br>\[m(z)=\frac{z-i}{z+i}\]<br>from the half plane to the disc. Then the sequence $\{m\circ f_n\}$ is a sequence of uniformly bounded holomorphic functions on $\Omega$, so by Montel's theorem $\{m\circ f_n\}$ is a normal family. That is, there is a function $g:\Omega\to\mathbb{C}$ which is the limit of a subsequence of $\{m\circ f_n\}$. Call this subsequence $f_k$ so that we can say $m\circ f_k\to g$. We know $g(\Omega)\subset\overline{\mathbb{D}}$ because $m\circ f_k\to g$. If there is an  $x\in\Omega$ for which $g(x)\in\partial\mathbb{D}$, then $g$ is not an open map and so must be constant. This contradicts the fact that $a$ was fixed by $\{f_n\}$, because $g(a)\in\mathbb{D}$ and if $g$ is constant it cannot also be that $g(x)\in\partial\mathbb{D}$. Thus $g$ maps into $\mathbb{D}$ and not its boundary. Then the subsequence $f_k$ converges to $g\circ m^{-1}$, a holomorphic map from $\Omega$ to the upper half plane.<br>If we drop the requirement of $a$ then the sequence $f_n(z)=ni$ provides a counterexample because no subsequence converges, and the sequence $f_n(z)=\frac{i}{n}$ converges to the constant function 0 but 0 does not map into the half plane, so there are two counterexamples.</p>

		<summary><strong>openImpliesLiouville:</strong> Use the open mapping theorem to prove Liouville's theorem.<br><br></summary>
		<p><strong>Solution: </strong>Without loss of generality, suppose $f:\mathbb{C}\to\{\mathbb{D}+2\}$ is holomorphic. Then $g(z)=\frac{1}{f\left(\frac{1}{z}\right)}$ is a holomorphic function from $\mathbb{C}^*$ into the bounded set $\left\{\frac{1}{\mathbb{D}+2}\right\}$. Because $g$ is bounded, $0$ is a removable singularity of $g$. That is, $f$ extends to a holomorphic function $F$ from the Riemann sphere to itself. We know $F(S^2)$ is compact because $F$ is continuous and $S^2$ is compact, and then $S^2$ is Hausdorff so $F(S^2)$ is therefore closed. If $F$ were nonconstant $F$ would be an open map, whereby $F(S^2)$ would be forced to be all of $S^2$. This cannot be the case because $F(S^2)$ is in the closure of $F(\mathbb{C})$ which is contained in a disc, and the closure of a disc cannot be the whole sphere. Thus $F$ is constant, making $f$ constant.</p>

		<p><strong>Solution: </strong>Let $z_0\in\mathbb{C}$.

Thus $\frac{n!M}{R^{n+1-\alpha}}\to0$ as $R\to\infty$. We are using the fact that $f$ is entire when we let $R\to\infty$. Thus $f^{(n)}(0)=0$ for all $n\geq0$, meaning all coefficients in the power series are $0$, so $f$ is constantly 0.<br>Note that we showed $f=0$, which is stronger than $f$ is constant. That is because of the way this question is worded, in fact $|f(0)|\leq M|0|^\alpha=0$ so $f$ being constant implies that $f$ is $0$ under this bound.</p>

		<summary><strong>q14_3:</strong> Show all solutions of $e^z=3z^2$ with $|z|<1$ are also solutions of $z=\overline z$.<br><br></summary>
		<p><strong>Solution: </strong>We will use Rouche's theorem, which states that if $|f|<|g|$ on $\partial\Omega$ then $g$ and $f+g$ have the same number of roots in $\Omega$. First look at the function $e^z-3z^2=e^z+(-3z^2)$, we want the roots of this function. If $|z|=1$, then $|-3z^2|=3$. Also,<br>\[|e^z|=|e^{x+iy}|=|e^x|=e^x\]<br>and <br>\[\frac{1}{e}\leq e^x\leq e\]<br>for $-1\leq x\leq1$. Additionally, $e<3$ so in particular $|e^z|\leq e<3=|-3z^2|$. Now we know how many roots $-3z^2$ has in the unit disc, it has 2 (we have to count multiplicity). That means $e^z-3z^2$ has 2 roots in the unit disc. However, $e^z-3z^2$ has 2 roots on the real interval $(-1,1)$, we can prove this with the intermediate value theorem. If $h(x)=e^x-3x^2$ then <br>\[h(-1)=\frac{1}{e}-3<0\] <br>\[h(0)=1>0\]<br>\[h(1)=e-3<0.\]<br>Thus $h$ has a (real) root between $-1$ and $0$ and another root between $0$ and $1$. These are the only roots of $e^z-3z^2$, as we already saw, by Rouche's theorem. The fact that they are real means they are solutions to $z=\overline z$, as required.</p>

		<summary><strong>q14_5:</strong> Determine a Mobius transformation which maps the upper half of the unit disc to the first quadrant. Also, find a conformal map which maps the portion of the unit disc in the first quadrant biholomorphically to the upper half plane. Give an explicit function.<br><br></summary>
		<p><strong>Solution: </strong>The upper half of the unit disc can be described with four key points, $-1,0,1,i$. Following those points encircles the upper half of the unit disc in the positive direction. Also, the angles at each of the points are $\frac{\pi}{2}, \pi,\frac{\pi}{2},\pi$. Describing the first quadrant in the same way can be done with the four points $0,1,\infty,i$ which encircles the region in the positive direction with the same angles. Thus we want our transformation $f$ to have $f(-1)=0, f(0)=1, f(1)=\infty, f(i)=i$. By $f(\pm1)$, we must have<br>\[f(z)=\alpha\frac{z+1}{z-1}.\]<br>By $f(0)=1$, $\alpha$ must be $-1$. Thus <br>\[f(z)=-\frac{z+1}{z-1}.\]<br>Checking for $i$ gives <br>\[f(i)=-\frac{i+1}{i-1}=-\frac{(i+1)(i+1)}{(i-1)(i+1)}=-\frac{2i}{-2}=i\]<br>as we wanted. Thus $f$ is the mobius transformation which takes the upper half disc to the first quadrant. <br>For the second part, use $z^2$ first to change the first quadrant intersected with the unit disc into the upper half of the unit disc. This is conformal because $0$ is the only problematic point and $0$ is not in our domain. After that, use $f$ to get the first quadrant. Then square again to get the upper half plane. That is, our map $g$ is given by <br>\[g(z)=\left(f(z^2)\right)^2=\left(-\frac{i-iz^2}{z^2+1}\right)^2.\]</p>

		<p><strong>Solution: </strong>By Montel's theorem this is equivalent to showing that $\mathcal{F}'$ is locally bounded. By assumption (and Montel's theorem) $\mathcal{F}$ is locally bounded. Let $z_0\in\Omega$ and choose $M,\delta>0$ for the local bounded property, i.e. $\{z:|z-z_0|\leq\delta\}\subset\Omega$ and for all $f\in\mathcal{F}$ and all $z$ with $|z-z_0|<\delta$, $|f(z)|\leq M$.

Give a continuous function $f:\partial\Omega\to\mathbb{R}$ for which the Dirichlet problem is unsolvable and prove so.<br><br></summary>
		<p><strong>Solution: </strong>Perron's solution is to consider the class of functions which are subharmonic and which take values below the prescribed values. Specifically, let $S$ be the set of all functions $\phi:\overline\Omega\to\mathbb{R}$ such that for all $x\in\partial\Omega, \phi(x)\leq f(x)$ and for all $z_0\in\Omega$ holds the mean value sub-inequality<br>\[\phi(z_0)\leq\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^\pi\phi(z_0+re^{it})dt.\]<br>Perron's solution is then $\psi$ where<br>\[\psi(z)=\sup_{\phi\in S}\phi(z).\]<br>Now we move on to the second part. Let $f$ be the function defined on the boundary of $\Omega$ by $f(z)=0$ if $|z|=1$ and $f(z)=1$ if $z=0$. We will prove this is unsolvable. We instead prove the slightly different (though sufficient) claim which is that any continuous function $u:\overline{D}\to\mathbb{R}$ which is harmonic at all $z$ with $0<|z|<1$ and which vanishes on the unit circle must be constantly 0.<br>Suppose we have such a function $u$. Because $u$ is continuous and $\overline D$ is compact, $u(\overline D)$ is bounded. Let $M$ be a bound so $|u(z)|\leq M$ for all $|z|\leq1$. Take any point $z_0\in D^*$ where $D^*$ is the disc with the origin removed. Let $r\in(0,|z_0|)$ and define $A_r=\{z:r<|z|<1\}$. The function $M\frac{\ln|z|}{\ln r}$ is harmonic in $A_r$ and has boundary values of $0$ on the outer boundary $|z|=1$ and $M$ on the inner boundary $|z|=r$. Start with the bounded assumption on $u$, for all $z\in A_r$,<br>\[-M\leq u(z)\leq M.\]<br>Now we can investigate bounds on $\partial A_r$. Here we have the bounds<br>\[-M\frac{\ln|z|}{\ln r}\leq u(z)\leq M\frac{\ln|z|}{\ln r}.\]<br>This comes from the fact that all three terms vanish on the outer boundary of $A_r$ and on the inner boundary we get the previous line of inequalities. Because both $u$ and $M\frac{\ln|z|}{\ln r}$ are harmonic on the interior of $A_r$, these bounds extend to the interior of $A_r$. That is a result of the maximum/minimum principle of harmonic functions which states that the extrema of harmonic functions occur on the boundary. If we let $r\to 0$ in the above bounds, $\ln r\to-\infty$ meaning the outer terms vanish. Thus $u(z)=0$. Then $u(z)=0$ for all $z\neq0$ by repeating the argument, and $u$ is continuous so it must also vanish at the origin. That proves our claim and ultimately shows that our previous function $f$ cannot admit a Dirichlet solution.</p>

Prove that $f(G_+)$ lies either entirely above or entirely below the real axis.<br><br></summary>
		<p><strong>Solution: </strong>We will be hopelessly lost without knowing that $f(z):G\to\mathbb{C}$ is holomorphic if and only if $g(z)=\overline{f(\overline{z})}:\overline{G}\to\overline{\mathbb{C}}$ is holomorphic (all bars mean conjugate, no topological closures in this solution). Given this lemma, the assumption that $G=\overline{G}$, and the fact that $D=\overline{D}$, we get that both $f$ and $g$ are biholomorphisms from $G$ to $D$. Moreover, $g(a)=\overline{f(\overline{a})}=\overline{f(a)}=\overline{0}=0$ and we can show (my favorite is to use Jacobians but we will skip it for now) that $g'(a)=f'(a)>0$.

For all $r, 0\leq r<R$ and all $\theta$,<br>\[\frac{R-r}{R+r}f(a)\leq f(a+re^{i\theta})\leq\frac{R+r}{R-r}f(a).\]<br>Proof: This problem is useful for remembering the Poisson kernel. The steps are somewhat out of the blue, but if you have seen them before then they aren't too hard to come up with on the spot. Out of nowhere we pull the triangle inequality.\t<br>\[R-r\leq|Re^{it}-re^{i\theta}|\leq R+r.\]<br>We need to work this into the Poisson kernel and the mean value property. Good cues are that the outer bounds above guide our first steps, and the Poisson kernel will be what is left in the middle. We don't have to memorize the kernel for this problem, we actually end up creating it.<br>Square the inequalities.<br>\[(R-r)^2\leq|Re^{it}-re^{i\theta}|^2\leq(R+r)^2.\]<br>Flip them.<br>\[\frac{1}{(R-r)^2}\geq\frac{1}{|Re^{it}-re^{i\theta}|^2}\geq\frac{1}{(R+r)^2}\]<br>\[\frac{1}{(R+r)^2}\leq\frac{1}{|Re^{it}-re^{i\theta}|^2}\leq\frac{1}{(R-r)^2}.\]<br>Multiply all by $R^2-r^2$, which is positive because $r<R$.<br>\[\frac{R-r}{R+r}\leq\frac{R^2-r^2}{|Re^{it}-re^{i\theta}|^2}\leq\frac{R+r}{R-r}\]<br>Integrate all terms the same way, the way which makes the outer bounds become the mean value property. This step uses the fact that $f\geq0$ to preserve the inequality.<br>\[\int_{-\pi}^\pi\frac{R-r}{R+r}f(a+Re^{it})dt\leq\int_{-\pi}^\pi\frac{R^2-r^2}{|Re^{it}-re^{i\theta}|^2}f(a+Re^{it})dt\leq\int_{-\pi}^\pi\frac{R+r}{R-r}f(a+Re^{it})dt.\]<br>Voila, the outer terms are the mean value property and the inner term is the Poisson kernel.

Assume that for all points $z$ on $\gamma$,<br>\[|f(z)|<|g(z)|.\]<br>Then $g$ and $f+g$ have the same number of zeroes inside $\gamma$.<br>Proof: The number of zeroes $Z$ of $g$ is given by the argument principle, <br>\[\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{g\circ\gamma}\frac{1}{z}dz.\]<br>That is, the number of zeroes of $g$ inside $\gamma$ is the number of times the image of $\gamma$ under $g$ winds around $0$. We are going to show that this number is the same for $g$ as it is for $f+g$.<br>By our assumption, $|f(z)|<|g(z)|$ for all $z\in\gamma$. Take the straight line $tg(z)+(1-t)(f(z)+g(z))$ connecting $g(z)$ to $f(z)+g(z)$ for $0\leq t\leq1$. We will show this line does not pass through 0. For simpler notations, let $a=f(z)$ and $b=g(z)$. Then $|a|<|b|$ and we are claiming that $tb+(1-t)(a+b)\neq0$ for all $0\leq t\leq 1$. By assumption, $g(z)\neq0$ because $|g(z)|$ must be in particular strictly positive. Thus our claim holds for $t=1$.

We have shown this homotopy never hits $0$, so it is a path homotopy in $\mathbb{C}\setminus\{0\}$ which is the domain on which $\frac{1}{z}$ is holomorphic. Thus by Cauchy's integral theorem (path homotopy version), the integrals below are the same. <br>\[\int_{g\circ\gamma}\frac{1}{z}dz=\int_{(f+g)\circ\gamma}\frac{1}{z}dz.\]<br>Then by the argument principle, the number of zeroes of $g$ and $f+g$ are the same.</p>

		<p><strong>Solution: </strong>The maximum modulus principle states that if $f:\Omega\to\mathbb{C}$ is holomorphic and $G$ is a region with $\overline G\subset\Omega$ then the maximum of $f$ on $\overline G$ occurs on $\partial G$. Moreover, if there is a point $a\in G$ with $|f(a)|=\sup_G|f(z)|$, then $f$ must be constant on $\Omega$.<br>Let $B_r=\{z:|z|<r\}$ and $C_r=\{z:|z|=r\}$. Then for all $r$ with $0\leq r<R$, we know $\overline{B_r}\subset B_R$. By the maximum modulus principle,<br>\[\sup_{z\in B_r}|f(z)|=\sup_{z\in C_r}|f(z)|=M(r).\]<br>The left hand side clearly is a nondecreasing function of $r$ because $B_r$ is a larger set as $r$ gets larger. That shows that $M$ is nondecreasing. Moreover, if there are two points $r_1<r_2$ for which $M(r_1)=M(r_2)$ then there is a point $a\in \overline{B_{r_1}}\subset B_{\frac{1}{2}(r_1+r_2)}$ with $|f(a)|=\sup_{B_{r_2}}|f(z)|$. By the maximum modulus principle, $f$ must then be constant on $B_{r_2}$. The uniqueness principle then forces $f$ to be constant on $B_R$.<br>The fact that $M$ is continuous follows from the fact that $f$ is continuous, but we will give some details there now. We already know that $M$ is an increasing function, we just need to show it does not jump. Let $0\leq s<R$ and $\delta>0$ be given. Let $\epsilon'>0$ be small enough that $s+\epsilon'<R$. Let $B=\{z:|z|<s+\epsilon'\}$. Then $|f|:\overline{B}\to[0,\infty)$ is a uniformly continuous function (uniformly because of compactness). Let $\epsilon>0$ be small enough that for any $z,w\in B$ with $|z-w|<\epsilon$, $|f(z)-f(w)|<\delta$. Also choose $\epsilon<\epsilon'$. Now we show $M$ does not jump at $s$. For any $z$ with $s<|z|<s+\epsilon$, there is a $w$ with $|w|=s$ and $|w-z|<\epsilon$. Then $|f(z)-f(w)|<\delta$, so<br>\[|f(z)|-|f(w)|\leq|f(z)-f(w)|<\delta\]<br>\[|f(z)|<|f(w)|+\delta\leq M(s)+\delta\]<br>because $w\in C_s$. This last inequality shoes that for all $s'$ with $s<s'<s+\epsilon$,<br>\[M(s')< M(s)+\delta.\]<br>Thus $M$ does not jump past $\delta$ at $s$. This is for all $\delta>0$, so $M$ does not jump at $s$. This is for all $s$, so $M$ never jumps. Thus $M$ is continuous.</p>

		<p><strong>Solution: </strong>Note this is a lot easier to visualize with pictures of the graphs but we will try with just text. First we move one of the corners to the origin. The corners are the two points on the unit circle with distance $1$ to $i$, so $\frac{i}{2}\pm\frac{\sqrt 3}{2}$. The map $z-\left(\frac{\sqrt 3}{2}+\frac{i}{2}\right)$ moves our region down/left, putting one corner at the origin and the other at $-\sqrt 3$. The map $\frac{1}{z}$ then takes this region and removes the corner at the orign (moving it to $\infty$) and sending the other corner to $\frac{-1}{\sqrt 3}$. Translating via $z+\frac{1}{\sqrt 3}$ turns our region into a rotated version of the first quadrant, $\lambda z$ with a particular choice of constant with $|\lambda|=1$ sends our region to the first quadrant (the particular choice of angle would be easy enough to find if we had been tracing more points than just the corners but oh well). Now that we have the first quadrant we use $z^2$ to turn it into the upper half plane then the Mobius transformation $\frac{z-i}{z+i}$ to get the unit disc.</p>

		<p><strong>Solution: </strong>Statement: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a family of holomorphic functions defined on a region $\Omega$. Then $\mathcal{F}$ is normal if and only if $\mathcal{F}$ is locally bounded.<br>First, let's recall the Arzela Ascoli theorem (AA). That is that $\mathcal{F}$ is normal if and only if two properties: 1) for each $z_0\in\Omega$, the set $\{f(z_0)|f\in\mathcal{F}\}$ has compact closure in $\Omega$, 2) $\mathcal{F}$ is equicontinuous at every point $z_0\in\Omega$.<br>Equicontinuous at $z_0$ means that for all $\epsilon>0$ there is a $\delta>0$ such that for all $f\in\mathcal{F}$ and for all $z\in\Omega$ with $|z-z_0|<\delta$, $|f(z)-f(z_0)|<\epsilon$.<br>To be locally bounded at $z_0\in\Omega$, there have to be constants $M,r>0$ such that for all $z\in\Omega$ with $|z-z_0|< r$, for all $f\in\mathcal{F}$, then $|f(z)|< M$.<br>Now to work on the theorem. Suppose $\mathcal{F}$ is normal and let $z_0$ be an element of $\Omega$. Then the result of Arzela-Ascoli theorem holds. Let $M$ be such that $|f(z_0)|\leq M$ for all $f$, this is result 1) of AA. By result 2), there is a $\delta>0$ such that $|f(z)-f(z_0)|< M+\epsilon$ for all $f\in\mathcal{F}$ and for all $z\in B_{\delta}(z_0)$. This shows that $\mathcal{F}$ is locally bounded at $z_0$, with the constants $M+\epsilon$ and $\delta$.<br>Now suppose that $\mathcal{F}$ is locally bounded at all points in $\Omega$. This assumption immediately shows part 1) of AA, because bounded subsets of $\mathbb{C}$ are relatively compact. We need to show $\mathcal{F}$ is equicontinuous at $z_0$. Take the constants $M,r$ from the definition of locally bounded, also choose $r$ small enough so that $\overline{B_r(z_0)}\subset\Omega$. Then for all $z\in B_r(z_0)$ and all $f\in\mathcal{F}$, we have asusmed that $|f(z)|\leq M$.<br>Let $\epsilon>0$ be given. Let $z\in\Omega$ with $|z-z_0|<\frac{r}{2}$. Let $\gamma$ be the circle $|z-z_0|=r$. By Cauchy's integral formula applied to arbitrary $f\in\mathcal{F}$, <br>\[|f(z)-f(z_0)|=\left|\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_\gamma\frac{f(w)}{w-z}dw-\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_\gamma\frac{f(w)}{w-z_0}dw\right|=\frac{1}{2\pi}\left|\int_\gamma\frac{f(w)(z-z_0)}{(w-z)(w-z_0)}dw\right|\]<br>\[\leq\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_\gamma\left|\frac{f(w)(z-z_0)}{(w-z)(w-z_0)}\right||dw|.\]<br>Here we will use some bounds. $|f(w)|\leq M$, $|w-z_0|=r$, and $|w-z|\geq\frac{r}{2}$. Thus<br>\[\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_\gamma\left|f(w)(z-z_0)\frac{1}{w-z}\frac{1}{w-z_0}\right||dw|\leq\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_\gamma M|z-z_0|\frac{2}{r}\frac{1}{r}|dw|=\frac{M}{\pi r^2}|z-z_0|\int_\gamma|dw|=\frac{2M}{r}|z-z_0|<\frac{3M}{r}|z-z_0|.\]<br>Therefore if we choose $\delta$ to be $0<\delta<\frac{r\epsilon}{2}$ (so this whole argument applies) and less than $\frac{r}{3M}$, then we have shown equicontinuous and therefore (by AA) normal.</p>

		<p><strong>Solution: </strong>See the theorem section for a detailed construction. The process is to use the fact that $\Omega\neq\mathbb{C}$ to obtain a point $a<br>otin\mathbb{C}$ so that we can translate $\Omega$ so that it does not contain the origin. Once we know we don't include $0$, we can define a branch of log and use the assumption of simply connected to show this is well-defined. We use this branch of log to define a square root function which is $\pm$ injective. The image under this square root must then not contain any pairs $\pm z$ by $\pm$ injectivity, so in particular the region does not contain an entire open set. Then we translate so that an entire neighborhood of the origin is disjoint from our region. Inverting with $\frac{1}{z}$ gives a nonconstant bounded function which ultimately started in $\Omega$.</p>

		<p><strong>Solution: </strong>First we will show that $u$ satisfies the maximum principle. Suppose there is a point $a\in\Omega$ with $u(a)\geq u(z)$ for all $|z-a|<r$ where $r>0$ is small enough that $|z-a|\leq r\implies z\in\Omega$. By the mean value property,<br>\[u(a)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^\pi u(a+re^{it})dt\leq\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^\pi u(a)dt=u(a).\]<br>There is a fact in analysis that if a continuous function $\phi$ has $\phi\geq0$ and $\int\phi=0$ then $\phi=0$. We use this on the integral<br>\[\int_{-\pi}^\pi u(a)-u(a+re^{it})dt=0.\]<br>The inside is nonnegative by the maximum assumption, so $u(a)=u(a+re^{it})$ for all $t$. This also works for any $r$ small enough that the ball of radius $r$ centered at $a$ fits in our region, so we have proven that $u$ is constant near $a$. Thus we have shown that $u$ satisfies the maximum principle.<br>Now that we know $u$ satisfies the maximum principle, let $a\in\Omega$ and let $r>0$ be small enough that the ball $B$ centered at $a$ of radius $r$ is in $\Omega$. Let $v$ be the solution to the Dirichlet problem which agrees with $u$ on the boundary of $B$,<br>\[v(a+se^{i\theta})=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^\pi P_s(\theta-t)u(a+re^{it})dt.\]<br>Then $v$ is harmonic, so it satisfies the maximum principle as well. Moreover the function $u-v$ also satisfies the maximum principle.The function $u-v$ is constantly $0$ on the boundary of $B$, though, so $u-v\leq0$ inside $B$. The same argument shows $v-u\leq0$ inside $B$ as well, so $u-v=0$ in $B$. That is, $u=v$. Now we now $v$ is harmonic because that's the point of the Dirichlet problem, so $u$ is also harmonic at $a$.

That is,<br>\[\int_\mathbb{R}f(z)dz=\int_{-\infty}^\infty\frac{\cos(ax)}{1+x^2}+i\frac{\sin(ax)}{1+x^2}dx.\]<br>Moreover, $\sin(ax)$ is an odd function and $\cos(ax)$ is an even function. Thus<br>\[\int_0^\infty\frac{\cos(ax)}{1+x^2}dx=\frac{1}{2}\int_\mathbb{R}f(z)dz.\]<br>To find this, let's instead try to solve $\int_\gamma f(z)dz$ where $\gamma$ is the boundary of the upper half disc of radius $R$ centered at the origin. $f$ is a meromorphic function on $\mathbb{C}$ with poles only at $\pm i$. As long as $R>1$, Cauchy's integral formula tells us that<br>\[\int_\gamma f(z)dz=\int_\gamma\frac{e^{iaz}/(z+i)}{z-i}dz=2\pi ie^{ai^2}/(i+i)=\pi e^{-a}.\]<br>Now we just need to estimate the arc portion of $\gamma$. Let $p$ be the curved portion of $\gamma$. Then $p(t)=Re^{it}$ for $t\in[0,\pi]$. An estimate for $f\circ p(t)$ is <br>\[|f(p(t))|=\left|\frac{1}{1+R^2e^{2it}}e^{iaRe^{it}}\right|\leq\frac{1}{R^2-1}\left|e^{iaR(\cos(t)+i\sin(t)}\right|\]<br>\[=\frac{1}{R^2-1}\left|e^{-aR\sin(t)+iaR\cos(t)}\right|=\frac{1}{R^2-1}e^{-aR\sin(t)}.\]<br>Because $0\leq t\leq\pi$, we know that $\sin(t)$ is nonnegative. Then $-aR\sin(t)\leq0$, so $e^{-aR\sin(t)}\leq1$. Thus, on $p$,<br>\[|f(p(t))|\leq\frac{1}{R^2-1}.\]<br>Then the integral is bounded by<br>\[\left|\int_pf(z)dz\right|\leq\int_p|f(z)||dz|=\int_0^\pi|f(p(t))|Rdt\leq\int_0^\pi\frac{1}{R^2-1}Rdt=\frac{R\pi}{R^2-1}\to0.\]<br>That is, the contribution from $p$ vanishes as $R\to\infty$. Thus<br>\[2\int_0^\infty\frac{\cos(ax)}{1+x^2}dx=\int_\mathbb{R}f(z)dz=\lim_{R\to\infty}\int_\gamma f(z)dz=\pi e^{-a}.\]<br>So our answer is $\frac{\pi}{2}e^{-a}.$</p>

		<p><strong>Solution: </strong>First, are we dividing by zero? How do we know that $p'(a_i)\neq0$ for all $i$? This is because the roots are distinct. If $p'(a)=0$ then $a$ is a root of order at least 2, so it is not a distinct root. Therefore $p'(a_i)\neq0$ for all $i$. Moreover, note $p$ takes the form<br>\[p(z)=\lambda\prod_{i=1}^n(z-a_i)\]<br>by the fundamental theorem of algebra. Now to answer the question. Let $R>0$ be large enough that all $|a_i|<R$ and let $\gamma(t)=Re^{it}$. Consider the integral<br>\[\int_\gamma\prod_{i=1}^n\frac{1}{z-a_i}dz.\]<br>Fix any $i$ and use Cauchy's integral formula for the curve $\gamma_i$ which encircles only the pole at $a_i$.<br>\[\int_{\gamma_i}\frac{\prod_{j\neq i}\frac{1}{z-a_j}}{z-a_i}dz=(2\pi i)\prod_{j\neq i}\frac{1}{a_i-a_j}=(2\pi i)\frac{\lambda}{p'(a_i)}\]<br>The last equality comes from the multi-chain-rule computation of $p'$, plugging in $a_i$ cancels most of the terms. Therefore<br>\[\int_\gamma\prod_{i=1}^n\frac{1}{z-a_i}dz=(2\pi i)\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{\lambda}{p'(a_i)}.\]<br>Alternately, let $d$ be the degree of $p$. Then $|\prod_{i=1}^n(z-a_i)|\sim R^d$ as $|z|$ gets very large. Then the integral is<br>\[\left|\int_\gamma\prod_{i=1}^n\frac{1}{z-a_i}dz\right|\sim\left|\int_\gamma\frac{1}{R^d}dz\right|\leq2\pi\frac{1}{R^{d-1}}\to0.\]<br>The limit goes to 0 because $d\geq2$.

Take the constants $M,r$ from the definition of locally bounded, also choose $r$ small enough so that $\overline{B_r(z_0)}\subset\Omega$.

Thus<br>\[\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_\gamma\left|f(w)(z-z_0)\frac{1}{w-z}\frac{1}{w-z_0}\right||dw|\leq\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_\gamma M|z-z_0|\frac{2}{r}\frac{1}{r}|dw|=\frac{M}{\pi r^2}|z-z_0|\int_\gamma|dw|=\frac{2M}{r}|z-z_0|.\]<br>Therefore if we choose $\delta$ to be $0<\delta<\frac{r}{2}$ (so this whole argument applies) and less than $\frac{r\epsilon}{2M}$, then we have shown that $\mathcal{F}$ is equicontinuous because<br>\[|f(z)-f(z_0)|\leq\frac{2M}{r}\delta<\frac{2M}{r}\frac{r\epsilon}{2M}=\epsilon.\]</p>

		<p><strong>Solution: </strong>Let $C$ be the unit circle $|z|=1$. We will show that if a function $f:D^*\to\mathbb{R}$ is both harmonic and bounded and has $f(C)=0$ then it must be that $f=0$, in particular meaning that $f$ extends to all of $D$. Once we show that, we will relate it to the current problem.<br>Let $f:D^*\to\mathbb{R}$ be harmonic and suppose $|f(z)|\leq M$ for all $0<|z|<1$ and that $f(z)=0$ for all $|z|=1$. Let $r$ be a real number with $0<r<1$ and consider the set $A_r=\{z:r<|z|<1\}$. Take the harmonic function $\frac{M}{\ln r}\ln|z|$ on $A_r$. If $|z|=1$ then $\frac{M}{\ln r}\ln|z|=0$, and if $|z|=r$ then $\frac{M}{\ln r}\ln|z|=M$.<br>The boundary of $A_r$ is $C\cup C_r$ where $C_r=\{z:|z|=r\}$. On the boundary of $A_r$ hold the bounds<br>\[-\frac{M}{\ln r}\ln|z|\leq f(z)\leq\frac{M}{\ln r}\ln|z|.\]<br>The maximum principle for harmonic functions extends these bounds to all of $A_r$. Let $z_0\in D^*$. Then for all $0<r<|z_0|$ we have the bounds<br>\[-\frac{M}{\ln r}\ln|z_0|\leq f(z_0)\leq\frac{M}{\ln r}\ln|z_0|.\]<br>The outer terms vanish as $r\to 0$, which means $f(z_0)=0$. Thus $f$ is constantly $0$ on $D^*$. Moreover, $f$ extends to a harmonic function on $D$ because $f$ is constant. This proves our claim.<br>Now suppose $u$ is a bounded harmonic function on $D^*$. We know there is a harmonic function $v$ on all of $D$ which is equal to $u$ on $C$, this is the Dirichlet problem. We know $v$ is bounded because $\overline{D}$ is compact and $v:\overline{D}\to\mathbb{R}$ is continuous. Then the function $u-v$ is harmonic and bounded on $D^*$ and vanishes on $C$. By the previous work, $u-v=0$ on all of $D^*$ and therefore can be extended to be $0$ on all of $D$. Then $u=v$ on $D$, so $u$ is harmonic.</p>

		<p><strong>Solution: </strong>The singularity of the Mobius transformation $M(z)=\frac{z-i}{z-1}$ happens at $z=1$, so we will probably not be able to get our radius of convergence to be greater than $1$. Let's see where the unit disc goes under $M$. We have a trace of the unit circle as $1\mapsto i\mapsto -1\mapsto 1$, this maps to the sequence $\infty\mapsto0\mapsto\frac{1}{2}(1+i)\mapsto\infty$. That is, $M$ takes the positively oriented unit circle to the line $y=x$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ going upwards. Conformal maps preserve orientation, so the disc goes to the upper-left half plane. Then we can define a branch of log on the image under $M$, for $re^{i\theta}=w=\frac{z-i}{z+1}$ we have that $\theta\in(0,2\pi)$ and<br>\[\ln(w)=\ln(r)+e^{i\theta}.\]<br>In terms of $z$ (where $|z|<1$), take $\arg$ to output values in the interval $(0,2\pi)$.

We use this fact on the integral<br>\[\int_{-\pi}^\pi u(a)-u(a+re^{it})dt=0.\]<br>The inside is nonnegative by the maximum assumption, so $u(a)=u(a+re^{it})$ for all $t$. This also works for any $r$ small enough that the ball of radius $r$ centered at $a$ fits in our region, so we have proven that $u$ is constant near $a$. Thus we have shown that $u$ satisfies the maximum principle.<br>Now that we know $u$ satisfies the maximum principle, let $a\in G$ and let $r>0$ be small enough that the ball $B$ centered at $a$ of radius $r$ is in $G$. Let $v$ be the solution to the Dirichlet problem which agrees with $u$ on the boundary of $B$,<br>\[v(a+se^{i\theta})=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^\pi P_s(\theta-t)u(a+re^{it})dt.\]<br>Then $v$ is harmonic, so it satisfies the maximum principle as well.

The same argument shows $v-u\leq0$ inside $B$ as well, so $u-v=0$ in $B$. That is, $u=v$.

We know $\Sigma_g$ has universal cover the upper half plane, which is conformally equivalent to the disc. Recall the lifting criterion for covering spaces, $f$ will lift as a continuous function into $D$ if $f_*:\pi_1(\mathbb{C})\to\pi_1(\Sigma_g)$ satisfies $f_*(\pi_1(\mathbb{C}))\subseteq p_*(\pi_1(D))$, where $p$ is the projection map from $D$ to $\Sigma_g$. This condition is satisfied because both groups are simply the trivial group, so $f$ lifts as a continuous map. Now we claim $f$ actually lifts as a holomorphic map.<br>Given a continuous map, the property of being holomorphic at a point is a purely local one. Moreover, the projection map $p$ is locally a biholomorphism. That means (get ready for a mouthful) that for every point $z\in\mathbb{C}$ there is a neighborhood $U$ of $z$ for which $f(U)$ is a neighborhood in $\Sigma_g$ on which there is a holomorphic map $p^{-1}:f(U)\to D$ such that $p\circ p^{-1}=id_U$. The lift $\tilde f:\mathbb{C}\to D$ is defined to be $p^{-1}\circ f$ on $U$, that is how we construct lifts. Then $\tilde f$ is the composition of holomorphic maps on $U$, so $\tilde f$ is holomorphic at $z$. Then $\tilde f$ is a holomorphic map from $\mathbb{C}$ to $D$.<br>Lioville's theorem forces $\tilde f$ to be constant. Because $f=p\circ\tilde f$, $f$ is also constant. That is our required result.</p>

		<summary><strong>q18_8:</strong> Prove that a topological $S^2$ admits only one complex structure.<br><br></summary>
		<p><strong>Solution: </strong>Let $X$ be our $S^2$ with some arbitrary complex structure. Let $R$ be the Riemann sphere, i.e. $S^2=\mathbb{C}\cup\{\infty\}$ with the standard charts $(S^2\setminus\{\infty\},z),(S^2\setminus\{0\},\frac{1}{z})$. Take a point $p\in X$. Take a chart $(U_p,\phi_p)$ such that $\phi_p(p) = 0$. Consider $f:U_p\to R$ where $f(z)=\frac{1}{\phi_p(z)}$. Since $\phi_p$ is a holomorphic chart, $f$ is a meromorphic function with only a simple pole at $p$ (note $f$ is not defined on all of $X$, just near $p$).<br>Let $\psi$ be a smooth cutoff function such that $\psi=1$ on a neighborhood around $p$, $0\leq\psi\leq1$ on $U_p$, and $\psi=0$ outside $U_p$. Now we can consider the product $\psi f:X \setminus\{p\}\to R$ as a function. Note that<br>\[\overline{\partial}(\psi f) = \overline{\partial}(\psi)f + \overline{\partial}(f) \psi = \overline{\partial}(\psi)f\]<br>by the product rule and the fact that $f$ is holomorphic on its domain iff $\overline{\partial}(f) = 0$. Let $\alpha = \overline{\partial}(\psi f)=\overline{\partial}(\psi)f$. Since $\psi = 1$ near $p$, we know $\overline{\partial}(\psi) = 0$ near $p$. Thus $\alpha=0$ near $p$, so it can be extended at $p$ to give a (0,1) form defined on all of $X$. <br>Recall our space $X$ has genus $0$. Therefore the dimension of the Dolbeault cohomology $H_X^{(0,1)}$ is $0$, meaning $H_X^{(0,1)}=0$. That means every $\overline\partial$ closed $(0,1)$ form is $\overline\partial$ exact. In our setting, that means $\alpha=\overline\partial(g)$ for some $(0,0)$ form (smooth function) $g$.<br>Now we have that $\alpha=\overline\partial(g)$ for a smooth function $g$. Define the function $\phi:X\to R$ by $\phi=\psi f-g$. Then<br>\[\overline\partial(\phi)=\alpha-\overline\partial g=0.\]<br>That means $\phi$ is a holomorphic map into $R$, i.e. a meromorphic function. Moreover, any poles of $\phi$ must come entirely from $\psi f$ because $g$ is a bounded smooth function ($g:X\to\mathbb{C}$ and $X$ is compact). That means that $\phi$ has a single pole of order 1, and it is at $p$. Because the degree of any holomorphic map is constant, the degree of $\phi$ as a holomorphic map into $R$ is constantly $1$. Thus $\phi$ is actually a bijection, meaning $\phi$ is a biholomorphism from $X$ to $R$.</p>

		<p><strong>Solution: </strong>Assume $f$ is not constant, for the result is trivial if it is. Using translations and rescalings we can assume, without loss of generality, that $G=\mathbb{D}$, $a=0$, and there is some $M>0$ such that $|f(z)|<M$ for all $|z|<1$. Note $f'$ is defined on $\mathbb{D}^*=\mathbb{D}\setminus\{0\}$. First we produce a bound for $f'$ near $0$. Let $a$ have $0<|a|<\frac{1}{2}$ and let $\gamma$ trace out the circle $|z-a|=\frac{|a|}{2}$. By Cauchy's integral formula<br>\[|f'(a)|=\frac{1}{2\pi}\left|\int_\gamma\frac{f(z)}{(z-a)^2}dz\right|\leq\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_\gamma\frac{|f(z)|}{|z-a|^2}|dz|\leq\frac{1}{2\pi}\frac{M}{\frac{|a|^2}{4}}2\pi\frac{|a|}{2}=\frac{2M}{|a|}.\]<br>Let $g:\mathbb{D}^*\to\mathbb{C}$ be defined by<br>\[g(z)=z^2f(z).\]<br>Then for any $z$ with $0<|z|<1$,<br>\[g'(z)=2zf(z)+z^2f'(z).\]<br>By the bound produced above, $z^2f'$ and therefore $g'$ is continuous at $0$ (taking $0$ to $0$). Then $g$ is analytic on the disc. Moreover both $g$ and $g'$ vanish at the origin, so $g$ has a root of order at least 2 there. By the degree argument there is a natural number $d\geq2$ and an analytic $h$ such that<br>\[g(z)=z^dh(z)\]<br>on all of $\mathbb{D}$. Then $f=z^{d-2}h$, so $f$ is analytic on $\mathbb{D}$.</p>

		<p><strong>Solution: </strong>Clearly $f_n\to f$ on $A$, we will use a connectedness argument to show $A=G$. By Montel's theorem and the Arzela-Ascoli theorem the family $\{f_n\}$ is normal and hence equicontinuous.<br>Let $w$ be a limit point of $A$ in $G$ and let $\epsilon>0$. By equicontinuity there is a $\delta>0$ such that for all $n$, $|z-w|<\delta\implies|f_n(z)-f_n(w)|<\frac{\epsilon}{2}$. Because $f$ is continuous we can shrink $\delta>0$ if necessary so that $|z-w|<\delta\implies|f(z)-f(w)|<\frac{\epsilon}{4}$. By definition of limit point there is an $a\in A$ with $|w-a|<\delta$. Because $a\in A$ there is an $N>0$ such that for $n>N$ $|f_n(a)-f(a)|<\frac{\epsilon}{8}$. Then for all $n>N$<br>\[|f_n(w)-f(w)|=|f_n(w)-f_n(a)+f_n(a)-f(a)+f(a)-f(w)|<\frac{7\epsilon}{8}<\epsilon.\]<br>Therefore $f_n(w)\to f(w)$ so $A$ is closed. Now we show $A$ is open.<br>Let $a\in A$ and $\epsilon>0$. Because $a\in A$ there is an $N>0$ such that for all $n>N$ we have $|f_n(a)-f(a)|<\frac{\epsilon}{2}$. Take $\delta>0$ small enough that $B_\delta(a)\subseteq G$ and the following estimates hold for all $z\in B_\delta(a)$ and all $n$:<br>\[|f_n(z)-f_n(a)|<\frac{\epsilon}{4}\]<br>\[|f(z)-f(a)|<\frac{\epsilon}{8}.\]<br>This is possible because $f$ is continuous and $\{f_n\}$ is an equicontinuous family.

		<p><strong>Solution: </strong>First consider the evaluation map $ev:H_X^{\;1,1}\to\mathbb{C}$ given by $ev(\rho) = \int_X \rho$. We claim that this gives an isomorphism of vector spaces between $H_X^{\;1,1}$ and $\mathbb{C}$. To show $ev$ is well defined, suppose $[\rho] = [\tau]$. Then $\rho-\tau\in im\left(\overline{\partial}\right)$ by the way $H_X^{\;1,1}$ is defined. Let $\rho - \tau = \overline{\partial}f(z)dz$, this is possible because $\rho-\tau\in im\left(\overline{\partial}\right)$. By using Stokes theorem along with the fact $\partial f(z)dz = \frac{\partial f}{\partial z}dz\wedge dz=0$, we have<br>\[ev(\rho-\tau)=\int_X\overline{\partial}f(z)dz=\int_X dfdz=\int_{\partial X}f(z)dz=\int_{\emptyset}f(z)dz=0.\]<br>Hence the evaluation map is well defined. Also $ev$ is a linear map since integration is linear.<br>To show that $ev$ is surjective, recall (if you happen to have seen it before) that any orientable manifold admits a nowhere-vanishing volume form. Since $X$ is orientable, and volume forms for Riemann surfaces are $(1,1)$ forms (think $dz\wedge d\overline z$), let $\rho$ be a nowhere-vanishing volume form. Then $ev(\rho)\neq0$. We can rescale the integral by considering $a\rho$ for $a\in\mathbb{C}$ if need be to get any $c\in\mathbb{C}$, so $ev$ is surjective.<br>Now assume $ev(\rho) = 0$. We want to show $\rho \in im(\overline{\partial})$ so that $\rho = [0]$ in the cohomology class. Consider the equation given by $\overline{\partial}\partial f = \rho$. A fundamental PDE result says the existence of a solution to this equation happens iff $ev(\rho) = 0$. By assumption, we can find $\alpha = \partial f$ such that $\overline{\partial}\alpha = \rho$. Thus $\rho \in im(\overline{\partial})$, hence $\rho = [0]$. Thus the map is injective. Thus the spaces are isomorphic.</p>

		<p><strong>Solution: </strong>If 0 is a removable singularity of $g$ then $\lim_{z\to\infty}f(z)=g(0)$. We claim this makes $f$ bounded. Let $R>0$ such that<br>\[|z|>R\implies|f(z)-g(0)|<1.\]<br>Then for all $|z|>R$ we have $|f(z)|<|g(0)|+1$, so $f$ is bounded for $|z|>R$. The set $\overline{B_R(0)}$ is compact and $f$ is continuous, so $f$ is bounded there too. Thus $f$ is bounded and therefore constant by Liouville's theorem. For the reverse direction, if $f$ is constant then $g$ is constant so the singularity is trivially removable.<br>Now suppose the singularity of $g$ is a pole. Then $\lim_{z\to\infty}f(z)=\infty$. That is, $f$ extends to a holomorphic function from the Riemann sphere to itself. We know the only holomorphic functions from the Riemann sphere to itself are rational functions, and $f$ has no poles in $\mathbb{C}$, so $f$ must be a polynomial. The reverse direction, as in the previous case, is trivial.<br>Finally for the essential singularity case. By the Casorati-Weierstrass theorem, the image of any (punctured) neighborhood of $0$ under $g$ is dense because $g$ has an essential singularity there. The image of $g$ can differ from the image of $f$ by at most the single point $f(0)$, so the image of $B_R(z)^c$ under $f$ is also dense in $\mathbb{C}$. For each $n$, let<br>\[U_n=f\left(\overline{B_n(0)}^c\right).\]<br>Then each $U_n$ is an open dense set. By the Baire category theorem,<br>\[W=\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty U_n\]<br>is dense and, in particular, nonempty. Let $w\in W$. Then for every $n$ there is a point $y_n\in\mathbb{C}$ with $|y_n|>n$ such that $f(y_n)=w$. There must be infinitely many distinct $y_n$ because no complex number has infinite modulus. This proves the forward direction. For the reverse direction, suppose there is such a $w$. The roots of $f-w$ must grow arbitrarily large as per the uniqueness principle because $f$ is not constant. Then the roots of $g-w$ must grow arbitrarily small. If the singularity at $0$ were removable, the uniqueness principle would show $g$, and hence $f$, to be constant, which is not the case. The singularity is certainly not a pole because $g$ vanishes arbitrarily close to 0, it cannot approach $\infty$ near 0. Thus the singularity is essential.<br>For the \"FTA,\" suppose $f$ is a nonconstant polynomial. Then the singularity of $g$ is a pole and hence not essential. We know $f$ to be nonconstant, so it must be that the preimage of any point (0 in particular) under $f$ is finite.</p>

We want to look at the integral<br>\[\int_\gamma\frac{1}{z-p(s)}dz.\]<br>We will do a change of variables. Let $\gamma_s(t)=\gamma(t)-p(s)+a$. Note $\gamma_s(t)$ never hits $a$ for any $s,t$ because $p$ never hits $\gamma$. Also $\gamma_s'=\gamma'$ and<br>\[\int_\gamma\frac{1}{z-p_s}dz=\int_0^1\frac{\gamma'(t)}{\gamma(t)-p_s}dt=\int_0^1\frac{\gamma_s'(t)}{\gamma_s(t)-a}dt=\int_{\gamma_s}\frac{1}{z-a}dz.\]<br>We have constructed a path homotopy from $\gamma_0$ to $\gamma_1$, where the image of the homotopy lies in $\mathbb{C}\setminus\{a\}$. Thus, by Cauchy's integral theorem,<br>\[\int_{\gamma_0}\frac{1}{z-a}dz=\int_{\gamma_1}\frac{1}{z-a}dz.\]<br>Note that $\gamma_0$ is just $\gamma$, so the left hand side is $(2\pi i)n(\gamma;a)$. The right hand side is<br>\[\int_0^1\frac{\gamma_1'(t)}{\gamma(t)-p(1)+a-a}dt=\int_0^1\frac{\gamma'(t)}{\gamma(t)-b}dt=\int_\gamma\frac{1}{z-b}dz=(2\pi i)n(\gamma;b).\]<br>Thus $n(\gamma;a)=n(\gamma;b)$.</p>
